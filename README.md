restaurant_data.ipynb
I have fetched all data and displayed it in the cells below. The API keys can be verified and the cells can be run again if needed. However, it would be best to just view the data that has been generated in the cells below and it should give you a good understanding of the data I have collected anc cleaned.
The database connection details are also displayed and I used RDS Database for this project. I have hosted it on aws and used Postico to establish the connection details. 
I have used these details in my notebook to connect to my database and create the tables.
I then inputted the data I collected into the corresponding columns in those tables.

restaurant_analysis.ipynb
Feel free to play around with this. The data has been inputted from the database into the dataframes so there is no need to run the database connection details again. You can use those dataframes and run the cells to view the corresponding analyses and visualizations.

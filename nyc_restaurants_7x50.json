They also helped cut the slice in half so I could share with a friend.\n\nI would recommend visiting this location if you are around the area.

I recently indulged in their famous treats, and let me tell you, it was absolutely delicious. The moment you step inside, you're greeted by the warm, inviting aroma of freshly baked goods that instantly puts you in a good mood.\n\nThe highlight of my visit was definitely their iconic banana pudding, which is creamy, decadent, and simply divine. It\u2019s no wonder this dessert has garnered a loyal following! I also tried their classic cupcakes, and each bite was a delightful explosion of flavor, perfectly moist and topped with rich, buttery frosting. The variety of treats available makes it hard to choose, but everything I sampled was fantastic.\n\nBeyond the delicious offerings, Magnolia Bakery holds a special place in pop culture history, particularly for fans of HBO's \"Sex and the City.\" This charming bakery gained fame as one of Carrie Bradshaw's favorite spots, often featured in scenes where she enjoyed a sweet treat while navigating the ups and downs of life and love in NYC. The iconic image of Carrie walking down the street with a cupcake in hand has become synonymous with the bakery, making it a pilgrimage site for fans of the show.\n\nThe atmosphere in the West Village location is cozy and nostalgic, with a charming decor that adds to the experience. It\u2019s the perfect spot to sit back, enjoy a treat, and soak in the vibrant energy of the neighborhood.\n\nOverall, Magnolia Bakery is not just a place to satisfy your sweet cravings; it\u2019s a slice of New York City history that continues to capture the hearts of locals and visitors alike. Whether you're a \"Sex and the City\" enthusiast or simply someone who loves delicious baked goods, a visit to Magnolia Bakery is an absolute delight!",

A \u2018standard\u2019 beer costs $10 and they have some craft beers in cans for $14.\n\nThe music, as you\u2019d expect, is excellent. It\u2019s not so easy to see from the bar - this is fine if you\u2019re going fairly casually to enjoy the experience but book table seating if you want to properly see the band. The sound is still great at the back, with dedicated speakers. Each gig lasts ~45/50 minutes, with two gigs per evening (early and late). There is also a small but well stocked shop upstairs. Accessibility is excellent with a metro stop very nearby and regular trains to the rest of the city. The gig finished just before midnight but the area was still bustling.\n\nNot a cheap club but iconic with excellent live music.

The outdoor seating along the charming cobblestone street is just fantastic. Personally, I can't get enough of their flavorful fajitas and their wide variety of drinks and snacks. And if you have a sweet tooth, you've got to try their Dark Chocolate Tamal - it's a must! The service is always top-notch, the food is consistently delicious, and the atmosphere is fantastic. Whether it's lunch, dinner, or weekend brunch, Dos Caminos is definitely worth a visit. And with over 150 tequilas to choose from, it's the perfect place to party in the Meatpacking District",

The best dishes I tried were the octopus and a radicchio salad. The crab pasta listed serrano chilis but had no heat and the crab itself was bland and without flavor. The biggest disappointment was the pork chop with cherry tomatoes and cippollini. The pork was horribly overcooked (they didn't ask a temperature). It was covered in bell peppers and chopped onions, there was exactly one cippollini and half of a cherry pepper. We sent it back and it was removed from the bill.\nThe restaurant could only be described as tired. There's so many better options not far, try those.",

Thea was also very helpful in assisting me with my side choices after I informed her of my pork and beef allergy, which I only had to state once and she made sure to go over every single side that was available for me. The staff was amazing the customer service was above and beyond and the facility was very clean. The food was a 10/10 I got the lunch special rice bowl with chipotle bbq chicken, Mac n cheese, and sweet potatoes\u203c\ufe0f Highly recommended \u263a\ufe0f",

Everything was perfect, the food, the atmosphere, our waiter, the music, the piano, the host. I had the beef wellington and my daughter had lamb I believe.

It was a Caesar salad, seafood angel hair pasta, ribeye steak, steak with wine pairing, caviar service, and macaroni and cheese. It took him 2 minutes to recite all the ingredients and prices and we laughed. I said it should be its own menu and he said they chef forces them to keep them all as specials to seem more exclusive.\n\nBy the time he came to us, we had already read the regular menu so the specials should have been offered sooner\u2026 and on a menu.\n\nWe got the kale salad and 2 burgers. The kale salad was soaked in dressing. Like the leaves were heavy. And it was a thick dressing that took away any flavor. I got indigestion. From a kale salad. Let that sink in. And I could taste the salt on my tongue.\n\nOnce we finished the burgers came. A half pound of ground beef with a thin single slice of cheese: it felt like we were eating large undercooked meatballs. But it is \u201cthe Waverly\u201d so we gave it a shot, not the worst in the city but I wouldn\u2019t get it again.\n\nAnd then the fries- imagine the bottom of a bag of potato chips being dropped into a deep fryer for 3 minutes too long. My fingers had oil on them so I switched to a fork. And they actually come to\nThe table in the frying container! It\u2019s outrageous. No flavor besides oil, and comes w three drops of ketchup.\n\nOn top of it all, the host was dressed like he was hosting the Grammys and not looking up from his desk.  That\u2019s probably fine for the few times Andy Cohen comes in, so the host can pretend that celebs still haunt this place and that\u2019s how to be a good stealthy host. However, the real clientele is typically 3 to 4 different groups of 22-26 year olds white kids at  birthday parties. It\u2019s like a chuck e cheese for kids who moved to the city. Loud and obnoxious and not a chill spot anymore. The host is chuck e!\n\nBring back the way it used to be. Until then, I hope this review helps.",

Established way back in 1868, this spot has built strong ties with its butchers, ensuring they get the first pick of the finest beef. You'll find nothing but prime, dry-aged meat here \u2014 it's a promise they've kept since day one! Plus, they snagged the Wine Spectator Award in 2006.\n.\nThe restaurant might not be huge, but its charming; old-school decor adds to the cozy atmosphere. While it\u2019s nestled in Chelsea, the vibe is all about comfort and tradition. The service here is generally great, though sometimes it feels a bit understaffed during visits. Just a heads up: they don\u2019t serve complimentary bread.\n.\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the food! The New York Strip and Ribeye, cooked just the way you like and seasoned perfectly. Instead of traditional sides, you can decided to share the spicy Thai fried calamari, which is sweet and delicious, along with the stuffed shrimp. Everything is cooked to perfection, and you'll definitely plan to return. With an incredible ambiance, rich history, and fantastic wine selections, you won\u2019t want to miss this staple of New York City.",

I went with the Crispy Bell and Evans Chicken, and it is absolutely delicious. The skin was perfectly crisp, and the chicken itself was juicy. The mashed potatoes with gravy were superb.  Service was great here as well. I was expecting your usual tourist trap kind of establishment, but this place exceeded my expectations. It is definitely worth checking out if you are a fan of \"Friends\" and are looking for a place to dine while in the area.

At first it was a little intimidating as I was alone and all seats were taken. Luckily a seat became available at the bar and I swiped it. Service was amazing, cockails were spot on. I had the Smoke on the Water, After Midnight and the Yankee Notions. Bartender explained the prep process of all drinks.

But once the food was ordered, everything was much faster.\n\nThere were a lot of frustrated diners crowding the lobby before and after our meal, who would often check in with the host on the status of their tables, so I don\u2019t this was a one off experience just for us. Also had a glimpse of their system and they pack the table schedules in so tight, with no buffer between seatings. You\u2019re bound to wait here.\n\nAs for the food, we ordered 2 pastas, 2 appetizers, and 1 glass of wine for lunch, coming at a total of $100 before tax/tip for two.

Whether you\u2019re savoring oysters from the raw bar or diving into a lobster roll, each dish captures the essence of seaside dining with a touch of New York sophistication.\n\nWe stopped by for Happy Hour, which runs from 4pm to 6pm. We ordered the shrimp and avocado sliders, fish tacos, clam chowder, and lobster Mac and Cheese. Everything was absolutely delicious. At the end of the meal came complementary chocolate dessert which was a much appreciated gesture.\n\nEvery detail, from the food, to the attentive service, and the decor, has been thoughtfully crafted to create a comfortable and memorable dining experience.

Light enough to be floppy, but also strong enough to stay together when you fold it in your hand. And the first crispy bite of flavor is just food heaven. The pizza crust also has quite a bit of flavor, which is rare in most pizzas, and is perfectly baked to get the nearly burnt but crunchy texture.\n\nThe cheese: The fresh mozzarella is my favorite, so savory and melts in your mouth.\n\nThe tomato sauce: Those San Marzano whole-peeled tomatoes really shine in this sauce, which is bursting with flavor.\n\nGet the fresh mozzarella slice! Although the classic cheese and Sicilian slice are good too.\n\n$3-5 for a slice is a great deal, $25 for a pie. Cash Only, fast service, the line can be long but always moves fast.",

This is not our first time dining at a \"locally sourced ingredients\" establishment or a Michelin-starred place. We also tried not to leave any food uneaten, knowing that the products were locally sourced, but this does not reflect our thoughts on the dishes.\n\nThe meal started on a fun note with different types of cucumbers paired with a green dip that was quite delicious. However, from that point onward, the main course was disappointing, despite the theme of the lunch being French brasserie.\n\nThe salad and ratatouille were nice, but the mussel dish tasted bitter due to the sauce, and the steak and potato plate was quite dry and rubbery. I've had similar dishes many times before, so it wasn't an issue of trying them for the first time.\n\nAs for the dessert, it was a large donut with apricot filling. It was served without any utensil to cut it, which might have been fine. However, the donut itself seemed to have been sitting out for a while\u2014the bread tasted oily, and the filling inside was unfortunately quite sour. Even my partner, who usually enjoys all types of desserts, did not enjoy this one.\n\nLastly, regarding the service, everyone was friendly, but given that it was a menu-less place, we would have appreciated some explanation about the dishes without having to ask about each one.\n\nWe are not sure if we'd like to return to this place, although we might give it another chance since the menu changes seasonally.

Notably very well situated inside a deli styled turn-of-the-century store front and interior with a painted antique white tin ceiling. An original architectural element retained in the layout of its interior design. The comfort level was not overwhelming and though there were side tables featured for pairing two people per se, at one, there were only six available places to choose from. Most were occupied singly while there. Spaces were limited due to seating used for customers waiting on orders to go during their busiest rush times. But on a Sunday like today, the atmosphere turnover is quite ginger. A relaxed mood and sensibility aside the clamorous momentum behind the counter filling the orders as quickly as assembled. Now, to be perfectly honest, The Traditional classic smoked lox, with cream cheese on a bagel with everything  on it, on an Everything Bagel\u2014 was pretty decent. What was tough to get past was the toughness of the bagel itself. Like chomping European hard-bread made in America. In all fairness having tasted many many bagels this was tougher, chewy, and really harder to bite through. Seriously my preference would be its competitor further up the street closer to W. 23rd. Though, that was its only drawback! Nothing else. The lox, absolutely fresh. Tomatoes, capers, red onions, and cream cheese, perfect! Nothing more than satisfying! But the bagel was the only downfall. I\u2019m not opposed to the whole place for it\u2019s popularity but, as finicky as a kid can get to be, it\u2019s hard not to decide on finding another place that doesn\u2019t have that hardness tacked to the taste, and especially bagels. They can be extra soft, and really fluffy and tasty too. So, otherwise, a truly beautiful place no matter what the opinion is, (it is indeed very Scandinavian) totally in the  ambiance and aesthetic culinary tradition. But \u201cDon\u2019t mind me\u201d \u2026 it\u2019s just a matter of preferences like anything else here in The Big Apple!",

Funny thing is that Google reviews from NYC foodies placed higher at 4.6 stars. My boyfriend ordered rigatoni and I ordered the Bisteca (steak). The rigatoni was tough like either the pasta dough wasn't made in right proportions or it was cooked too al dente. Even fresh grated Parmesan sprinkled over it couldn't save it. I ordered the steak medium well. The beef was tender but the temp was off with a little too red still. It came with about 3 radicchio leaves and a small serving side of potatoes, which was probably the best part of all that was ordered. Service was great though the food was not to par, the waiter kept on refilling our glasses with NY finest tap water.",

The asparagus salad is also not to be missed. You must get both of their cheese appetizers, the bass, and their salmon main. It had to be one of the best salmon dishes I've ever had. The preparation was flawless. The broth was incredible; it was a nice juicy piece with the crispy skin...incredibly well executed. The Balthazar bread is always excellent. The deserts, strawberry shortcake and chocolate dish...delicious.  We were full, but made room, they were too good to leave behind. Thank you a million times over. Please keep doing what you're doing, all of you. You clearly continue to take pride in your culinary craft, and hospitality. I can tell that you don\u2019t skim on quality of ingredients either, in true JG form. Love this place. Location is amazing, close to the expansive water views.

The portion size is good as well. Although felt that there could have been more options, especially in the dips.\nEvery item looked good in the menu so we ordered a lot variety. I must say I had more expectations, therefore, I felt that the food lacked flavors. It was more aesthetically pleasing, flavor wise just decent.\nThe shakshuka didn't feel like a shakshuka, it was a soup rather. The bread in the Mushroom sandwich was hard as a rock making it difficult to eat. The puff pastry was good and crispy but the dish as a whole was just okay. For a Mediterranean place, their hummus was too plain and basic. I have had better hummus in other Mediterranean restaurants in NYC. The only thing I can vouch for is their pita bread- really good and freshly made. Otherwise the food felt just plain and simple not extraordinary. They didn't deliver according to the expectations.\nAlso didn't find the staff to be friendly and engaging. They were just doing their duty.\nI feel the restaurant has the potential to do much better.",

The food is always fresh and delicious, making it a favorite spot for many. There\u2019s never any issue with the quality or taste of the food; it\u2019s simply excellent.\n\nHowever, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, they only accept cash, so be prepared. If you\u2019re short on cash, you'll need to use the ATM right outside the store, which charges a $3 fee. The staff, while efficient, can sometimes come across as brusque, especially when you request extras like sauce on the side or if you\u2019re a dollar short. Also, seating is very limited, so it's best to plan on taking your food to go. The prices are slightly on the higher side, but given the quality of the food, it's worth it.",

The poached egg was a fun and tasty addition to the avocado toast. The avocado spread was good, along with the toast and tomatoes. Overall it was solid but I do tend to prefer more adventurous flavors.\n\nThe steel cut oatmeal with fruit was nicely done. The coconut shreds and almond slivers helped it quite a bit and were a nice touch more than regular oatmeal with fruit. I don't think I'll get it again simply because it is huge and I don't want to spike my blood sugar so early in the morning. But some people are eating French toast with syrup for breakfast so for those people this would be an improvement in terms of blood spiking.",

Their pita, very fresh and light, is dusted with za'atar and cumin. Falafel come in spicy or regular, both are delicious and light. Don't skip the Mint Ginger Lemonade. Good for kids and vegetarians who appreciate subtle flavors.  Fast counter service, nice staff, zero ambiance so it's better for takeout than to sit-in at their counter.",

There's much better Caribbean food elsewhere, especially uptown.\n\nThe jerk chicken was nice and spicy but a little dry inside. For most of the food here, it's a bit overpowering on the spice (rather than a careful cooking for the texture) so you're not a spicy food person? You may not like the menu.\n\nThe server was friendly and knowledgeable. The hostess had a lot of attitude. I arrived at 2:00 p.m. and the place was completely empty, but she acted like the place was fully booked. We had a reservation confirmed.\n\nFinally, there was something weird going on with the music. It would stop every now and then and the volume would fluctuate two notches up and down throughout the song. Kind of strange. The music gave it a nice upbeat vibe but also rendered a place. Not as great for intimate conversations.",

Our server Christina came over and introduced herself. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had such a warm and personable server as Christina. What a beautiful spirit she has. By the time we left it felt like we had known her for years. She truly enhanced our dining experience at Negril.\n\nAnd the food? Spot on! We had plantain as appetizers, which were perfectly made. One entree we had was lobster tails with a side of grits. Another was chicken roti. Both were delicious with just the right amounts of seasonings. We also had some crazy delicious drinks. One was passion fruit and another I don\u2019t recall exactly, except for the fact it was tasty and refreshing (that\u2019ll be the white colored one in the pics).\n\nI love the vibe of this place. The music is at the perfect level, (not too loud), and the interior design is pleasing to the eyes. Way back when I used to frequent the old place on 23rd when I lived in Chelsea, but I like the atmosphere at W. 3rd even more.\n\nThe only reason I\u2019m not rating Negril higher is because it took an unreasonably long time for our food to come out. We were told that our order had not printed out in the kitchen (or something to that effect). Because of the delay we were unable to make the next event of our evening and had to cancel and reschedule, which was disappointing. While the delay altered our evening plans, after we canceled the next event we were then able to relax more and enjoy the great dishes and environment. Gotta be flexible and roll with it sometimes.\n\nIn spite of the above, I\u2019m looking forward to returning (largely because of the amazing service Christina provided), and have already been thinking about what to get next time! In closing I admired the professional, yet warm and personable staff, loved the great food, and just simply enjoyed being there. Give Negril a try, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love it.\nHighly recommended!",

I think it\u2019s extremely hostile work environment! The  restaurant needs to hire HR or work with team more and explain that bullying colleagues is not right way to solve the problem! And management should know what going on and stop the conflict instead of watching it from the host stand .",

I'm not a huge fan of Italian food in the first place but my friend is vegetarian and really likes the penne from here. I got the tagliatelle ragu which was $18. The portions were a little small, they gave us some bread to snack on before the food came out which was nice. The complimentary bread was a little soggy (maybe from the rain, this establishment is pretty open which is nice). The waiters were all very nice and the food came out in a timely manner even though it was crowded.\nI wouldn't say it's my favorite but the pasta was a nice texture, there just wasn't an incredible flavor to it and the portions were smaller than I was expecting.\nFun place, not for me, but maybe for someone else!",

I know that everything has to move fast in Manhattan but sometimes its better to take things slow, especially for a restaurant that wants to be of a higher standard. The starters were brought out a little to fast after the appetizer but so far no comment. What got me a bit annoyed is that right after the starters i wanted to digest a bit and enjoy my glass of wine but about 5 to 10min later i got served with my main course.  Way to fast to even enjoy the whole food experience! The staff tried their very best to pamper you and have a great experience. The only thing they can do better is the timing of the courses. I spend around 500 USD. This included : 2 cocktails each, 1 appetizer, 2 starters, 2 main courses,  1 bottle of white wine and 1 dessert and of course a nice tip. So overal I like Gotham Restaurant,  I would dine here again, but next time I'll tell them we are not in a rush. Thank you Gotham Restaurant for the nice evening!",

This place is big so we only had to wait for about 10 minutes for a turnover in our favour.\nThe food itself was extremely generous to say the least but I need to just get used to this fact of life in the US and accept I will never finish a meal with my puny European appetite. We tried a mix of different things and they were all very satisfying.\nIf I had to complain about anything, I would say there was little to no fish in the Ceviche as it was mostly made up of seafood and I was a little surprised at the lack of spice in the dishes. That can easily be fixed by readily available hot sauces but it shows the dishes were adapted for a more international audience.\nMy final tip is that the sizes of cocktails come in 3 options:\n1. Too small\n2. Too big\n3. Animal feeding trough (sharing portion)",

The sommelier was very excited when I showed him a photo of what we had ordered at a restaurant on the West Coast.  He was more than happy to oblige, he directed us to a 2018 Reid Kellerberg Durnsteiner Riesling.  Told me this is his Dad\u2019s favorite.\n\nWe will definitely be dining again at Walls\u00e9.

The butternut squash soup is a must & dairy free (made of coconut milk). My mom & sister got the organic chicken and I got the cod, which was cooked perfectly & the sauces & veggies paired so well with it. The atmosphere is not too quiet and not too loud, just right.

One of the best dining experiences I\u2019ve had in New York for a long time. First of all, if you\u2019re looking for a restaurant with a reasonable noise level, this is a place for you. The staff is very attentive and knowledgeable. All the dishes were outstanding, from the presentation to the quality of the ingredients. I had the smoked salmon as an entree (excellent), and the schnitzel as an entree. We all had the schnitzel: out of this world! So light. My friend had the strudel for dessert (very good) and I had the best dessert of the house: kaierschmarren. TRY IT!!!!",

The rooms are on the small side but inviting, efficient and very comfortable.  The smallest details have been thought out in the room, with terrific bathrooms.  The breakfast was way better than expected from a buffet breakfast - it's all cooked fresh and real.  The hotel staff was so friendly and very willing to engage and help out.

The lush greenery and vibrant atmosphere gave us serious Miami vibes, a refreshing contrast to the sweltering heat of NYC right now. We were impressed by the quality and generous portions of the food and drinks. Speaking of drinks, they were excellent too! Frozen watermelon margarita is a MUST!\n\nAll food that we had is soo yumm! Beautiful and well decorated.\n- East Coast Oyster\n- Steamed Mussels\n- Maine Lobster Roll\n- Smashed Avocado\n\nHowever, the service was a bit slow. While our server was friendly, it took us more than 15 minutes to order our second round of drinks, which was a tad frustrating. Understandably, they seemed understaffed given how busy it was.\n\nOverall, despite the minor wait, we loved the ambiance and the delicious offerings here. Definitely worth a visit. Will be back!!",

We ordered escargot, balthazar salad and seafood ceviche for starters and for main I had the new york strip, and my wife and daughter ordered the steak and fries and her roommate had chicken...The escargot were really yummy and the salad was delicious but the ceviche was the best quality seafood ceviche I have had in a very long time. As to the main meal, the chicken was tender and tasty, the steak and fries (both) were just right and I enjoyed the new york strip. The fat and meat were both cooked to perfection.... For dessert we had pavlova and ice cream profitrolls. The rolls were OK but the chocolate sauce was sublime, dark chocolate with just the right smoothness and taste... The pavlova was a disappointment to me. I have had better in so many countries and back home. The merengue was too too too sweet and the texture was off. Plus I am accustomed to a pavlova with cream and not a lemon/lime mascarpone.... Anyway, the desert was not enough to detract from the experience.  I had a great time with lovely company and excellent food.... A definite place to visit.",

The classic margherita is chef\u2019s kiss, but honestly, every pie on the menu is a winner.\n\nThe vibe at Lombardi\u2019s is pure old-school New York. The walls are filled with history, and the atmosphere is warm and bustling, like a true NYC institution. It does get busy, so plan for a bit of a wait, especially on weekends. But once that hot, delicious pizza hits the table, you\u2019ll know it was worth every minute.\n\nNow, heads up \u2013 the pizza is fantastic, but it\u2019s definitely on the pricey side for what it is. You\u2019re paying for both the quality and the history, so just keep that in mind. If you\u2019re visiting NYC or even if you live here, this is one of those places you have to check off your food bucket list. It\u2019s New York pizza at its finest \u2013 just with a bit of a premium!",

We ordered beers and asked for waters as well since we had been walking all day. The beers were brought out immediately but the waters never came, even after asking 2-3 times additionally over the course of the meal. We counted 4 other groups sat around us getting waters. The waters never arrived, even when we asked for some to go. It felt a tad bit disrespectful having to ask constantly, but maybe it was just an off night. Other than that, definitely worth the visit.",

Was not crowded in the morning on Friday or Monday.\n\nSweet potato and brown sugar cronut of the month (Oct 2024) was great and is a rather light flavor. I expect they\u2019re all pretty great in their own way.\n\nDKA ended up being one of our favorite items especially when they\u2019re fresh. Flaky and sugary on the outside with pockets thicker areas in the middle. Very good!\n\nI would also highly recommend the cookie shot which is warmed to order and the vanilla milk is tasty!\n\nPerfect little egg sandwich isn\u2019t as little as you would think. Comes on a pretty standard sized brioche hamburger bun. This was better than the spinach quiche in my opinion. It was very light and fluffy. Quiche on the other hand has a light and flaky crust.\n\nStrawberries and cream pavlova looked like a fun item to try but it wasn\u2019t my favorite. Even though it wasn\u2019t my favorite, it was still pretty tasty.\n\nChocolate croissant was super chocolaty. Chocolate strips inside as well as weaves throughout the lamination.\n\nWish I had tome to try all the pastries!",

This month, we treated ourselves to their monthly flavour cronut, The Dulce de Leche with Gingerbread Ganache, and it was absolutely exquisite. The buttery, flaky layers combined with the rich, creamy dulce de leche filling and the perfectly spiced gingerbread ganache made for a comforting, cozy treat that\u2019s just right for the season.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t resist sampling a variety of other pastries, and every single one was exceptional. Enjoying our treats in the relaxed back garden area\u2014a peaceful and charming oasis\u2014made the experience even more special.\n\nThis bakery is a must-visit when you\u2019re in SoHo.

We had a reservation for 2 and the place was empty for the majority of our meal, and even fairly empty when we left. There were plenty of four tops, and almost every table was a four top except for four tables along the side that were for two people. Of course, the hostess sat at the table for two, very tiny, which barely fit our courses and beverages. Every other couple sat at the four top.\n\nAppetizers were mediocre. Entrees were average.  We shared everything except the Maui Maui.  The Caesar salad was not tossed properly. Most of the bites were fairly bland, you could barely taste the dressing. But then there was one or two bites that were incredibly potent, and the anchovy flavor was overwhelming.  My husband only received the bland bites. I had two bites of the Caesar, which I just described. I\u2019m sensitive to raw onions, which they disregarded, and the raw onions in the Panzanella was so powerful even though I removed it from my plate. I had just one bite of that as well. And I had less than half of a cheeseburger without the bun and 2 fries. The fries were stale and reheated, absolutely horrible. Toward the end of the meal, which I barely ate, I was not feeling too well and had to leave the table. Within 60 minutes after my meal, I was very ill.  Several hours later I continued to get worse.\n\nOutside of our past experiences which kept us from returning to Tribeca Grill, we have dined here twice with a friend who is considered their \u201cVIP\u201d and the service and meals during those experiences were fine. I can\u2019t stand restaurants that treat locals with less respect and deprive us of a proper experience even though we are the ones that would be supporting their business. I guess that\u2019s why we\u2019ve never considered Tribeca Grill our home base.\n\nI hate to only highlight the negative experiences, so I\u2019ll share the best part of the meal, which was the wine and of course the company. The Sommelier was also kind and attentive. Our second waitress was also pleasant, but our first impression from the host, hostess and the first waitress was rude and unwelcoming. We also had a nice bus boy who recognized half way through the meal that the table was unstable and did his best to address it. We appreciated his kindness but did not need the attitude from the first half of the staff, nor the illness from the food.",

                        "text": "Iconic jazz club in New York. I booked tickets fairly late, opting for bar seating on this occasion. I\u2019d recommend getting there early - I booked for the 10:30pm gig, with doors allegedly at 10pm but they were open when I arrived about 20 minutes before this. There are only 10 or so seats on the bar so if you want one you need to get in quick. Otherwise it\u2019s standing room only and very tightly packed! There\u2019s a minimum spend of $25 on the bar and $35 on the tables. A \u2018standard\u2019 beer costs $10 and they have some craft beers in cans for $14.\n\nThe music, as you\u2019d expect, is excellent. It\u2019s not so easy to see from the bar - this is fine if you\u2019re going fairly casually to enjoy the experience but book table seating if you want to properly see the band. The sound is still great at the back, with dedicated speakers. Each gig lasts ~45/50 minutes, with two gigs per evening (early and late). There is also a small but well stocked shop upstairs. Accessibility is excellent with a metro stop very nearby and regular trains to the rest of the city. The gig finished just before midnight but the area was still bustling.\n\nNot a cheap club but iconic with excellent live music. That said, for a beer it\u2019s no more expensive than anywhere else in the city! Great service, too.",

The food is delicious, but be prepared: reservations are recommended since it can get busy. Unfortunately, they don't take reservations on weekends, so expect long queues outside during those days. Plan your visit with this in mind to avoid waiting too long.\n\nThe menu features all the usual American breakfast and brunch favorites. One standout dish is the pancakes\u2014they\u2019re thicker than usual and incredibly fluffy, making them a must-try! Our guests were trying American breakfast food for the first time, and they absolutely loved it.\n\nIf you're a coffee lover, be aware that they only serve drip coffee, with no espresso or other coffee varieties available. It\u2019s good to know before you go!\n\nSeating options include both indoor and outdoor areas, each with separate queues. The indoor seating area is medium-sized, but due to its popularity, it can get crowded and noisy. While it\u2019s not a dealbreaker, it\u2019s something to keep in mind.\n\nOverall, this brunch spot is definitely worth a visit, just remember to plan ahead!",

The menu, featuring classic seafood dishes with inventive twists, reflects the freshest seasonal ingredients. Whether you\u2019re savoring oysters from the raw bar or diving into a lobster roll, each dish captures the essence of seaside dining with a touch of New York sophistication.\n\nWe stopped by for Happy Hour, which runs from 4pm to 6pm. We ordered the shrimp and avocado sliders, fish tacos, clam chowder, and lobster Mac and Cheese. Everything was absolutely delicious. At the end of the meal came complementary chocolate dessert which was a much appreciated gesture.\n\nEvery detail, from the food, to the attentive service, and the decor, has been thoughtfully crafted to create a comfortable and memorable dining experience. For anyone seeking a taste of the coast in the heart of the city, Mermaid Oyster Bar offers a refreshing, laid-back retreat.",

We started with a couple of cocktails which were great. Appetizers were one piece of thick cut bacon, 1/2 dozen oysters and fresh tomato and mozzarella. The bacon, which they cut into thirds, was incredible. Nice crisp on outside, juicy on inside with the perfect amount of fat. Oysters were super fresh and clean. The mozzarella was perfect consistency and tomato's were sweet. Porterhouse for 3 was cooked rare, as ordered. It was rare throughout with a nice char on the outside. The oil they use to cook on the plate was spectacular. We all dipped the pieces into it. Sides were creamed spinach, which was a vibrant green and delicious, German potatoes, crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside, and lobster Mac and cheese which had huge chunks of lobster. Dessert was tartufo, which I never order and it was delicious, and pecan pie. Both came with home made whipped cream, or schlag. It was super thick and cut the sweetness.  The service was attentive without hovering and the room is beautiful. I can't wait for another special occasion or for me to get a job where I can afford to go every week.",

It had a good flavor I will say that this restaurant is more of a Mexican cuisine than Cuban. We really enjoyed the atmosphere and the corn on the cob was on point. We will definitely come back when we need a quick bite, but not when we need a full meal. The service was OK, but they seem to be overwhelmed by the amount of customers that the restaurant can handle we had to ask for napkins like three times also getting the attention of the servers was a difficult as they\u2019re moving around a lot. The bathrooms are very tiny, the lighting is very dim, There is lots of posters and graffiti, but it goes with the neighborhood , I did not feel an AC running inside the restaurant so I am not sure if they run the AC during very hot days .Overall, not a bad place but again make sure you do you your research and check the menu before going in.",

Even my all linen fit was futile against the heat.\n\nWe entered the non-descript 39 seat hole in the wall cafe with tiled floors, a handful of barstools and faux leather booths for seating, and ceiling fans being the only weapon against the heat. It was JUMPIN, but we got a seat right away as they turnin tables quick.\n\nThe interior is a little beat up, and I mean that in the best way possible. I've never been to Cuba, but Cafe Habana is authentically Latin American. It reminds me of small places in Mexico or Puerto Rico that don't look like much when you enter, but the food BANGS.\n\nIt\u2019s a no frills place. Not like Tacombi though, don't get it twisted. Tacombi plays on Mexican culture, talking about the balmy beaches of the Yucat\u00e1n and sharing the beauty of authentic Mexican culture with the world and then looks you dead in the eye as they charge you $6.98 before tax and tip for a tiny little fish taco with no sides. Don't get me started on Tacombi. Tacombi is like big pharma to me.\n\nEnough about the opps, my b.\n\nWe ended up ordering the world famous corn, plantains, the cubano sandwich, and the marinated roast pork. The grilled corn, dressed in mayonnaise, cotija cheese, chili powder & lime was actually insane\u2026 I was initially like \u201cdamn this Equinox trainer has me paying $5 for some corn\u201d but thank GOD I did. I forgot one of the few absolutes in life\u2026 CORN MAN GETS PAID!!\n\nThe cubano sandwich ($18.95) came with fries, which is a rarity in NYC these days. It consists of Citrus marinated roast pork wrapped in ham with swiss cheese, chipotle mayonnaise & pickle on a toasted roll. The pork was so juicy that little pork juice was squirting down the roll on every bite\u2026 that visual is crazy lol but it was delicious.\n\nIf you're reading this and don't live in NYC you're probably like \"damn that's expensive he's trippin...\" but this is par for the course in the city, and absolutely Nolita/Soho cheap.\n\nI'm fascinated that a place like Cafe Habana exists in the Nolita/Soho area. I would expect it to be deep in Alphabet City or Union City. Idk. Cafe Habana is just so unpretentious, right smack in the middle of one of the most pretentious places in the world. New York City continues to surprise me everyday.\n\nIG @jnov_\nTiktok @jnov_reviews",

The calamari was probably the best I have ever had.   It was cooked and served in thus incredible broth.   The escargot also did not disappoint.  Sadly they don't offer bread to dip into the broth.  We had asked for bread and it came after.\n\nFor our next course we ordered the Basque paella.  I have no words to describe this.  It was perfectly cooked with fresh mussels, claims, calamari and shrimp. The chicken thighs and chicken sausage were a pleasant surprise as it is typically pork (Which I don't eat).  The portion was huge and I wouldn't have ordered another dish if I knew it was that big.  Finally we ordered the striploin with mushrooms.  The steak was cooked to perfection.\n\nMy critiques are their drinks.  The cocktails ordered were horrible and had to force ourselves to finish them.  Ordered their old fashion and a goose martini.  Both terrible.\n\nThe place was bumping for a Friday night.  Tables are too close and it was a bit too warm.",

There's much better Caribbean food elsewhere, especially uptown.\n\nThe jerk chicken was nice and spicy but a little dry inside. For most of the food here, it's a bit overpowering on the spice (rather than a careful cooking for the texture) so you're not a spicy food person? You may not like the menu.\n\nThe server was friendly and knowledgeable. The hostess had a lot of attitude. I arrived at 2:00 p.m. and the place was completely empty, but she acted like the place was fully booked. We had a reservation confirmed.\n\nFinally, there was something weird going on with the music. It would stop every now and then and the volume would fluctuate two notches up and down throughout the song. Kind of strange. The music gave it a nice upbeat vibe but also rendered a place. Not as great for intimate conversations.",

Our server Christina came over and introduced herself. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had such a warm and personable server as Christina. What a beautiful spirit she has. By the time we left it felt like we had known her for years. She truly enhanced our dining experience at Negril.\n\nAnd the food? Spot on! We had plantain as appetizers, which were perfectly made. One entree we had was lobster tails with a side of grits. Another was chicken roti. Both were delicious with just the right amounts of seasonings. We also had some crazy delicious drinks. One was passion fruit and another I don\u2019t recall exactly, except for the fact it was tasty and refreshing (that\u2019ll be the white colored one in the pics).\n\nI love the vibe of this place. The music is at the perfect level, (not too loud), and the interior design is pleasing to the eyes. Way back when I used to frequent the old place on 23rd when I lived in Chelsea, but I like the atmosphere at W. 3rd even more.\n\nThe only reason I\u2019m not rating Negril higher is because it took an unreasonably long time for our food to come out. We were told that our order had not printed out in the kitchen (or something to that effect). Because of the delay we were unable to make the next event of our evening and had to cancel and reschedule, which was disappointing. While the delay altered our evening plans, after we canceled the next event we were then able to relax more and enjoy the great dishes and environment. Gotta be flexible and roll with it sometimes.\n\nIn spite of the above, I\u2019m looking forward to returning (largely because of the amazing service Christina provided), and have already been thinking about what to get next time! In closing I admired the professional, yet warm and personable staff, loved the great food, and just simply enjoyed being there. Give Negril a try, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love it.\nHighly recommended!",

The mango was the best !!!\nThe staff are super friendly, warm and welcoming. They have all the cheesecakes on the display. The service is pretty quick, and the line moves quickly, so it is not much of a wait. They accept both cards and cash payments.\nThis is a cute and cozy shop, with limited space to stand and eat, so we ate some and packed some more for later. Their packing was pretty good too.\n100% would recommend coming here to try their cheesecakes. The portion size is perfect, and it's not too sweet and the flavours are yummy, but not overpowering.\nLoooooved this place so much !",

Light enough to be floppy, but also strong enough to stay together when you fold it in your hand. And the first crispy bite of flavor is just food heaven. The pizza crust also has quite a bit of flavor, which is rare in most pizzas, and is perfectly baked to get the nearly burnt but crunchy texture.\n\nThe cheese: The fresh mozzarella is my favorite, so savory and melts in your mouth.\n\nThe tomato sauce: Those San Marzano whole-peeled tomatoes really shine in this sauce, which is bursting with flavor.\n\nGet the fresh mozzarella slice! Although the classic cheese and Sicilian slice are good too.\n\n$3-5 for a slice is a great deal, $25 for a pie. Cash Only, fast service, the line can be long but always moves fast.",

Attempted to open the door at 5:30AM on 11/6/24, two employees made eye contact with me but the door was locked. They looked busy so I didn\u2019t bother them. They clearly see me waiting right in front of the door but don\u2019t say anything. At 5:40AM another customer comes and has to start banging on the window multiple times for them to sign through the glass that they\u2019ve decided to open at 6AM today instead of 5:30AM as listed on the door and online. Completely understand things happen in a business. Employee could call out, short on supplies, etc. However, common sense and common courtesy would say to put a sign on the door or have a 5 second conversation with your customer waiting outside your door. Were they planning on having me wait outside for 30 minutes? If someone is going to get coffee at 5:30AM in NYC, they likely have things to do and can\u2019t afford to wait around. Wish you all the best but not the brightest individuals working today.",

The food is always fresh and delicious, making it a favorite spot for many. There\u2019s never any issue with the quality or taste of the food; it\u2019s simply excellent.\n\nHowever, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, they only accept cash, so be prepared. If you\u2019re short on cash, you'll need to use the ATM right outside the store, which charges a $3 fee. The staff, while efficient, can sometimes come across as brusque, especially when you request extras like sauce on the side or if you\u2019re a dollar short. Also, seating is very limited, so it's best to plan on taking your food to go. The prices are slightly on the higher side, but given the quality of the food, it's worth it.",

Parm on Mulberry St. is a tiny restaurant that serves some of the best italian cuisine in big portions at a reasonable price. Although their menu is on the smaller side, each of their dishes come out fresh, hot, and very tasty. I usually enjoy their pizza garlic rolls and mozzerella sticks for appetizers and eggplant parm platter for dinner. The best part is that all the platters come with a side of spicy rigatoni that is very similar to the one at Carbone. Basically, you get a 2 in 1 deal when ordering a platter.\n\nSeating is very limited and it is crammed in the restaurant so be prepared to enjoy a hearty meal on a small table while bumping elbows with the person next to you. There are a couple tables in the restaurant and outside. There is also bar seating.\n\nThe staff is very friendly and attentive. They are good at making conversation and make you feel at home while you enjoy your meal.\n\nThis place is a must try!",

Within half an hour there wasn\u2019t a seat in the place.\nWe had the grilled octopus salad as well as the goat cheese and mango salad to start. Both were outstanding. For main courses we had the lobster risotto and the lamb shank. The lobster was cut into pieces like little prizes throughout the risotto. The bone on lamb shank over risotto was so tender it fell off the bone.\nWe will absolutely be back, we loved this meal!",

While it\u2019s listed as a \u201cCuban Restaurant & Rum Bar\u201d on Resy, the vibe leaned more towards a restaurant experience than a full-on rum bar.\n\nAs a Cuban who grew up in Miami, I had high hopes, and this place delivered. The menu is extensive and has all the Cuban classics: ropa vieja, vaca frita, rabo encendido, arroz con pollo, croquetas, papas rellenas \u2014 you name it. For appetizers, we went all out. The papas rellenas were excellent and became a table favorite. The ceviche (not strictly Cuban, but a welcome addition) was fresh, although the portion was on the smaller side. The tostones \u2014 both the plain and stuffed versions \u2014 were terrific, and the yuca frita was yummy. The croquetas were just okay; I\u2019ve definitely had better.\n\nI ordered the rabo encendido, and it was delicious but I didn\u2019t love the bone-to-meat ratio. The flavor, though, was spot on, and it came with rice and beans (like most of their other dishes). Portions were generous \u2014maybe too generous; most of us couldn\u2019t finish our meal. I also tried the rum old-fashioned, but it wasn\u2019t quite there; it was a bit watered down for my taste.\n\nThe service was excellent, with attentive staff who were helpful with their recommendations. They even treated us to complimentary cigars at the end.\n\nOne small downside was the temperature in the room we were in \u2014 it got pretty warm. They turned on the heat pump at my request, but it ended up adding a bit of a musty scent which wasn\u2019t ideal. Minor issue in what was otherwise a great evening.",

Old cuban cocktail was yum with a fresh sugar cane stick. Daily special ceviche was nice and tangy and fresh. The pulpo a la plancha was my fav of the night. Cooked perfectly, great texture and flavor. The crispy potatoes that came with were really good too! The daily special stir fried skirt steak with fried rice was very comforting! Bombon cubano was the perfect way to finish the meal. So decadent and nicely paired with fresh mint and strawberries and vanilla ice cream. Can\u2019t wait to go back and try other dishes!",

We closed out and got our change, the food immediately came, we\u2019re eating and talking and as I have a mouth full of food this waitress approaches me and my boyfriend on some \u201cso no tip?\u201d \u2026I\u2019m sorry but when ever have you gotten a tip before we\u2019re done eating? And who approaches their customers like that while they\u2019re eating and talking. I genuinely would never go out to eat anywhere and not tip, I tip fast food workers. Food industry is hard, especially in the city. I also normally don\u2019t write reviews but I was officially appalled when I looked over to see her with her co workers pointing at my check she just grabbed and telling her I didn\u2019t tip. At least walk farther away to speak badly on a customer. I approached her nicer than I should\u2019ve been explaining I had a bad night, I was trying to get more than 4 bites into my food but not tipping her was never on my agenda. After I approached her she fully fixed her attitude and tried apologizing, I appreciated the correction in behavior but honestly I didn\u2019t finish any of my food and immediately felt uncomfortable.  The male hostess and manager were very kind and the atmosphere was very nice, my only issue was that server",

Each dish was beautifully presented and bursting with flavor. The cocktails were equally impressive, expertly crafted and perfect for complementing the meal.\n\nThe staff at Beauty & Essex truly made the experience exceptional. Our hostess was incredibly friendly and welcoming, and despite the restaurant being packed, we experienced minimal waiting time for our reserved table.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend making a reservation at Beauty & Essex when visiting NYC. It\u2019s a delightful blend of fun, fantastic food, and a lively atmosphere that you won\u2019t want to miss. I can\u2019t wait to return on my next trip.",

While at that first table, we ordered drinks, then were advised by the waitress to order the appetizers and mains all together, and explained that our order would be phased in 2 courses. While waiting for the food, the table next to us got up and alerted us of a big roach going under our table. The manager moved us into the main dining area immediately. Shortly after moving to the new table, the appetizers and food came all at once. It felt from the start like we were being rushed. After another complaint, the manager comped our appetizers due to the restaurant's error. We also overheard the table behind us complaining about another issue, and they were comped with a couple of shots. The drinks we ordered were a hit or miss; the same drink came in too sweet or two strong. Don't think we will be coming back. It seems that the overall quality and service of the place has greatly declined.",

Once inside, you'll be greeted by an inviting modern decor and warm, attentive service that immediately makes you feel at ease.\n\nLet's start with the cocktail: an apple cider creation that was pure culinary artistry. It was the perfect balance of fall vibes but versatile enough to be enjoyed year-round. The apple flavor was bold, clearly locally sourced, and refreshingly crisp \u2013 not overly sweet, just perfection in a glass.\n\nNow, for the real reason I'd catch a flight back to NYC: the pancakes. These are not your average pancakes. Pancake-making requires real skill, and this chef knows exactly how to get it right. These beauties were fluffy but never soggy, with crispy edges that didn\u2019t taste burnt, and a texture so light they almost melt in your mouth. Sweet but not sugary \u2013 it\u2019s a delicate balance, and they nailed it. Honestly, these pancakes are in my top five of all time. Hats off to the kitchen for the love and mastery poured into every bite. You\u2019ll be rethinking your whole life with these pancakes! Absolutely phenomenal.",

Scrambled eggs were light and fluffy. I liked the grits but others in our group thought they needed to be looser with more butter. Fried green tomatoes were my least favorite they were not greasy, which is a big plus, but the batter was too thick and that\u2019s really all you tasted.  Homemade hot sauce was really good, pretty spicy and added a nice kick to the eggs. Small restaurant that is very popular  therefore very crowded. We had a reservation and got seated right away.

This is a common occurrence based on some of the reviews. These thieves wait for it to be more crowded to target people. We asked the bartenders and the bouncers and they seemed aware that this happens. If there is a ring of people going around and go to the bars to steal phones why are they allowed to enter? I had been here before, but can\u2019t believe this happened. I didn\u2019t think I needed to worry about my phone being stolen INSIDE my own purse. Thankfully my wallet was there still, but that is what they\u2019re doing. The place is fun, but is not worth having the trauma of getting your phone stolen in plain sight. Very disappointing. Reconsider going somewhere else; broke people come here to steal other people phones. I had to get a new iPhone and I was able to see where my old iPhone was and it literally says is in Senegal, Africa. This is whole scheme going around and I would\u2019ve be surprised the staff is in on it. Karma will find its way!",

I got my drink & water before they arrived several minutes later. Water glasses were quickly filled and the waiter came by again to take drink and food orders. We started with the oysters, unfortunately, they were a bit small and not so tasty -  was not a fan of the sauces provided. I would probably try this again as it\u2019s not really the season for oysters right now. The shrimp wantons was a table favorite, as was the calamari. The flatbread was small and just Ok. We ordered a second round of food as it was our dinner. The Manchego mac and cheese was outstanding! It was probably the best Mac n cheese I\u2019ve had at a restaurant with a healthy amount of cheese and perfectly prepared with a toasted top. The 3 of us were almost full but we managed to finish the very good truffle fries. I probably wouldn\u2019t order the roasted peppers next time, even though they were prepared excellently. All the food arrived piping hot, which should be easy to do but most places don\u2019t do this. The place was buzzy with people drinking but there was still room if you wanted to drink, arrive early for a table. Fantastic happy hour! Oct 2024",

Each dish was bursting with flavors that were both rich and delicate, surprising me, especially since I\u2019m not usually a big fan of Chinese cuisine. Congee Village truly changed my perspective. The variety and quality of the dishes we tried were remarkable \u2013 everything tasted incredibly fresh and well-prepared.\n\nOne of the highlights of our meal was the value for money. We were a group of eight, and the portions were impressively large, yet the prices were unbelievably affordable. It\u2019s rare to find such a great combination of quality and quantity at such reasonable prices in New York City.\n\nI highly recommend Congee Village to anyone looking for an authentic and delicious Chinese dining experience.

The vibe is consistently cool, with dim lighting, vibrant photos, and good music that set the perfect mood whether you\u2019re there for a dinner date or after-work drinks with friends. I\u2019ve even caught a live salsa band here, which was incredible, and celebrated a New Year\u2019s Eve that was unforgettable! The bartenders have always been chill and welcoming, especially Xavier. On my most recent visit, I enjoyed some light bites like the fried chicken dumplings and sake shrimp skewers, both were delicious! And, of course, my partner\u2019s favorite, the Lychee Martinis, never disappoint. Just a heads up, on weekends, it can get full, so plan to arrive a little early for the best experience. Highly recommend Verlaine as part of a fun night out in the area!",

There is an open kitchen in the middle, where you can see the chefs preparing dishes.\n\nStaff & service - staff is very warm and friendly, explained the dishes and answered our questions patiently. Service was quite quick, they brought the next course as soon as we were done with current. We got two complimentary dishes as well during the five course meal :)\n\nNow coming to the food\nComplimentary welcome item - we got carrot mousse served in a savory crunchy cone. It had different textures and flavors.\nPresentation- 9/10, taste - 9/10\n\nFirst course item - lettuce dish. Nice burst of flavors and lots of textures from creamy to crunchy.\nPresentation- 8, taste - 9\n\nSecond course - tomato dish. Nice pairing of donut, feta cheese and tomato jam\nPresentation- 8, taste-9\n\n2nd complimentary item - it was clear broth with sesame seeds and turnip flat noodles. It was quite tasteful as well.\nPresentation-7, taste -8\n\nThird course - corn dish. This dish was also good. Had few corn chips, corn soup, cilantro and little pasta bites.\nPresentation-6, taste -8\n\nFourth course - Eggplant dish. Liked the coconut curry and outer crust of the dish, however I didn\u2019t like the texture of the eggplant filling. It also lacked seasoning in the filling.\nPresentation-7, taste -4\n\nFifth course- Caramelized onion ice cream\nDefinitely a novel concept. Onion ice cream is sandwiched between choco chip cookies and served with framboise (raspberry sauce). If you eat ice cream on it\u2019s own, you can definitely taste onion flavor. It wasn\u2019t really something that I would go again for. But with the cookie and raspberry sauce, onion flavor gets masked nicely and is not overpowering. But I am glad I tried this wild flavor of ice cream \ud83d\ude04\nPresentation-7, taste - 7",

We didn\u2019t have a reservation and most definitely did not need one. Once we arrived we opted to sit at the bar. We had come during happy hour and were excited to have the opportunity to try some dishes and drinks out. Noted with beer but also tried the Casanova cocktail which tasted more like a vodka based summer drink. When it came time to food we dined on their tater tots and prosciutto pizza. All great for sharing! I\u2019d totally recommend this for a more intimate occasion if you do end up visiting.",

It had large chunks of fried salmon. The papaya salad was delicious too, not too spicy and so flavorful.\n\nThe Singapore noodles were delicious, but not what I was expecting. This is an egg noodle like fettuccine with soy sauce and oyster sauce. It tasted great, and I'd probably order it again, but just FYI it isn't a curry dish with Angel hair noodles!\n\nThe curry fries were yummy but I'd probably not order it again, I would prefer to keep the curry sauce separate for dipping.\n\nOverall, 5 stars!",

We were greeted by the delightful Aly who is an asset to this establishment. She\u2019s customer focussed, knows the menu well and preempted our next order. Her recommendation of the home made gnocchi was was spot on. Her colleague Debora was also delightful and another asset to this restaurant.\nThe meals were a good portion size filled with a depth of flavour that stayed on the palette for some time.\nWe skipped dessert but it was tempting. Time permitting, we will return.\n\nNotes: kid friendly but couldn\u2019t see any high chairs. It\u2019s New York so parking will never be great. Dietaries can be catered for is requested.

I will have a picture of her. I came here specifically because I looked online and saw they had a toast and bubbles special on Thursdays. I was super excited to try it but was disappointed by how the waitress treated me because of my skin color. I came alone only 20 minutes after they opened and it was very empty. The waitress sat me in the back. I asked to change my seat because there was no one there and she told me she couldn't cause there were tons of reservations. Another waitress had to assure her it was okay to change my table. I did the toast and bubbles and ordered a side of fries in which was not free I told her I was willing to pay full price only $12 I heard her whispering to the other waitress can we do that. I was very confused because I didn't ask her for a favor the fries cost $12 in addition to the special and I told her I was willing to pay for it cause I can afford the extra money so I could not understand why she asked that question. Overall food very good but I will not return if she still works there as she is racist. I left within 1 hour and it was not busy as it was claiming to be. She didn't even have the decency to give me the check she asked another woman who was not white to give it to me and collect it from me while she stood around doing nothing. To the owner fire her because black people have money too and if this is how she acts as a store manager at a jewelry store I would not want her to work for me!",

Menu states that spanakopita consists of feta and ricotta, though it just had spinach that tasted more like Horta rather than spinach because it was a bit bitter.\n\nWe said to the server that spanakopita lacks any cheese.. Meanwhile, our server confirmed with the kitchen that there should be cheese, which we did not find in any of the three pieces of the spanakopita. Service from the FOH on that issue 1/5.\n\nRemaining items were fine, not the best or any authentic Greek style.. Lamb skewer is dry, like overcooked. Fries were good.\n\nAfter the meal we were not asked about coffee/tea/ dessert. Instead they asked us if we want the check.\nWe got it and they included tips.\nNo matter the service I always tip at least 18%, but they are not supposed to be included if the party is less than 6 people (and it was just the two of us).\nNo matter the language we speak, it is not correct to immediately assume we are tourists :)\n\nAnyway, don\u2019t recommend if you want authentic Greek food.\n\n*would be great to improve spanakopita and work a bit on service.\nAttached is the spanakopita foto, please show me where is the cheese.",

I have had better salad at Greek diners. First it was just a plate of tomatoes and cucumbers. A few onions a bit of feta cheese and a few olives. It was pricey too do I was expecting a few nice slabs of feta, and where were the stuffed grape leaves? Where was the lettuce even? Huge slices of tomatoes. Why can\u2019t you slice them smaller? The best ever was the taxiki with grilled pita bread. That was very delicious. My cousin had the lemon soup which was very eggy tasting for some reason and not much flavor otherwise. Aside from the pita and taxiki sauce everything  was underwhelming.",

The restaurant is on the second floor and in a very vibrant downtown location for those who are familiar with SoHo.  I enjoyed all the recommended house favorites from the half lobster roll, yellowfin tuna, etc.  even the edamame was delicious.  The ambiance is welcoming and lively.  Our server was a bit busy so we ended up placing our order with another server who was also friendly and made some good recommendations.  It was an overall good experience and we would visit again in the future.",

The food was great, the service was awesome, the room was lovely and the food was really good.  I do not know Japanese names for the food we ate so let me just tell you in my own words.  The scallops on a skewer were really buttery and had a wonderful sauce.  Same can be said for the steak on a stick.  The sticky rice with spice tuna and avocado was delicious but it is not really spicy.  Everyone loved this dish.  The fried chicken is also great because of the sauces.  One is a hot sauce and one is a gently warm honey sauce.  We loved the veggie fried rice with egg.  The sushi was very good as well.  My favorite was the salmon which had a lot of flavor and melted in your mouth.  I loved the eel wrapped in cucumber.  Desserts were very good, we loved the banana split as well as the chocolate bread pudding.  They have espresso and all the other coffee drinks.  Each was great.  Very lovely evening.  We made our initial order then added to it after we decided how full we were.  Online there is a pdf menu but the non-pdf menu on the website has photos of every dish which we found very helpful.  Be prepared to go up a lot of steps when you enter, but it is worth it.  Also has a nice bar area.  Check out all of our reviews and look at all the photos below. If we do not like it we do no review it so all of the ones you see are places that are fantastic. Follow us if you like. We had over 52 million views in the last 12 months and we thank you for that. We don't get paid, we just love to eat. Be sure to click on \"RobH\" at the top of this review to see all of them and to follow us if you like good food and FUN.

I went in for a cheese slice, I asked how much and stated I would be paying in CASH so that I would not be charged tax, because that is the STATE LAW, if you are paying in cash tax is not charged, you can give the flat price. When I explained this to her that I\u2019m not paying with card so why is she charging me tax, she began to say that\u2019s what the owner makes them do. I just payed and stayed silent because at this point I was beginning to get frustrated. So not only was I over charged from the original price of a cheese slice, I get my slice and she literally burned the entire crust/breading of the pizza it was brick hard from being burnt, but I take a bite of the slice and it\u2019s literally dripping of oil like as if it had an entire bottle on it which is absolutely disgusting. All in all, I was over charged, given a burnt / oily disgusting slice. I will never return to this establishment. An absolute rip off. I will attach images so you can see how oily this slice is.",

Whether you\u2019re opting for a classic plain bagel or something more adventurous like an everything or sesame seed bagel, the quality remains top-notch. Their bagels are always fresh, often warm from the oven.\n\nKossar's offers a wide variety of spreads and toppings, from classic cream cheese and lox to innovative flavored cream cheeses that add a fun twist to your breakfast.\n\nThe vibe at Kossar\u2019s is casual, with a no-frills, old-school atmosphere that emphasizes the food. There\u2019s also plenty of space to sit and enjoy your meal if you\u2019re not taking it to go. One downside is that it can get busy during peak hours, especially on weekends, but the wait is always worth it.",

I did not get photos of all the food but those three were standouts for me!\n\nFor dessert, I had the donut which was very tasty. Service was friendly and attentive.

We decided to do the group deal for 6 that had the soups, 4 large plates and some small plates plus we got a few sides. As a vegetarian- the papaya salad, long beans and brussel sprouts were amazing- but that was in addition to all the other dishes. The pork, beef, seafood and chicken slayed. Plus to coconut rice was heavenly and unlimited! The dishes were brought out in the perfect timing possible and empty plates cleared immediately. The drinks were so good and also came out in record time. Honestly I would come back here in a heartbeat. If you\u2019re in the area be sure to check this place out.

The smash seating area is charming, though limited,  and don't get me wrong, the food is good! It's just not $15.00 good.

That being said, I hope you take this review as an informative review.\n\nAtmosphere: This place is roomy enough to move around. Clean for the most part. The decor is okay, compared to what it used to look before, they haven't changed much.\n\nService: Honestly, service can vary. Sometimes, it would be exceptional or just acceptable.\n\nFood: Having ordered a couple of times here, I can conclude that their food is pretty good. I mean, there can be a couple of small things that can certainly not be to everyone's liking, but for the most part, their food is pretty good. This last time I ordered the Howling Wrap, which personally is enough for a quick bite since it is filling. I like the way they make their doughs, right on the spot. However, if you wait a bit long to eat it, the dough could turn as if it is uncooked making it less flavorful. There are no issues with the rest of ingredients. Their sauces are on point as well.\n\nPrices: This is another thing that would not be to everyone's liking. Yes, their prices are high. However, I acknowledge their location and rent is not cheap there. I also acknowledge that their food is tasty. Therefore, their food's quality and flavors are worth paying what they cost. (If they raise their prices a couple of bucks more, then it would not be worth)",

The food quality was great and the prices were right.\n\nTo start, we got the beef momos and the tangtsel salad, which was basically a pickled cabbage salad with some nice spices mixed in. Also got the chili chicken, which was a great mix of tomato-based saucy and spicy (don't forget to drizzle the lemon!) My only criticism would be that the chili chicken dish was that the dish was mostly crisp and not enough chicken. Will be back to try some other dishes from the menu.",

However, as the evening progressed, the dishes fell surprisingly short on flavor, leaving much to be desired in taste and creativity. Additionally, the service, while polished, lacked genuine engagement. Some servers seemed to be going through the motions, delivering rehearsed lines rather than showing true attentiveness to the guests.

I love to find people passionate about what they do in life, this makes a huge difference. We chose the option in the menu with 5 courses, all them extremely well presented and deliciously each one. We only missed a piano as background, but the atmosphere was so welcoming and the other guests so respectfully quiet that we felt honoured to be in the middle. Highly recommend this restaurant for everyone that wants a nice dinner and gastronomic experience in French cuisine in Manhattan.

If you have a reservation for a specific time, you might not be seated right away. You could end up waiting at the bar for at least 15 minutes before getting a table. The waiting area is overwhelming and loud. However, once you're seated, you'll find yourself in one of the most incredible dining interiors in NYC. The atmosphere is incredible, though the restaurant is very dark and loud.\n\nAs for the food, I think it's good, but the prices are quite high. Keep in mind that it's easy for two people to spend over $300. I recommend trying the chicken lettuce wraps, the crispy cauliflower, and the spicy tuna. For drinks, their strawberry wine vodka is delicious. The overall dining experience is great, and the service is very fast. However, there's pressure to leave within an hour. My party and I were ordering and eating at a normal pace, but we kept being presented with the check even though we weren't finished.

The staff were friendly and very attentive. The menu had a variety of options, but not an overwhelming amount. The food was amazing and came out quickly. I tried motza ball soup for the first time and was very impressed! Since it was my man\u2019s birthday, they gave us complimentary cookies and sang \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d. It was a wonderful lunch with a warm and welcoming atmosphere. Another great part is that you can grab a pastry to go or come sit inside for a nice meal. Will definitely be recommending to friends and family! \ud83d\uddfd\ud83e\ude75",

The wings, while large, were just doused in red hot sauce, leaving them soggy and way too vinegary. The nachos were huge and looked a bit better. Beer selection was average, but nothing special and slightly disappointing for NYC. The only non major brand offered was Lagunitas which isn't exactly a tiny craft shoppe these days. The others were all domestic staples that were not at all exciting. I guess it is supposed to be a traditional Irish pub which is supposed to allow for a rougher atmosphere, but I just found it slightly dirty and sticky.

Service was professional and the place has a lovely atmosphere. While it was pretty busy when I went, it wasn\u2019t loud. And all the dishes I tried were wonderful. The salmon tartare starter was delicious and I enjoyed the mix of fresh and smoked salmon, topped with a dollop of caviar. For my main, I got the duck character, a hearty mix of duck confit, duck sausages and sauerkraut. I love duck and this was so good! And finishing with their creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, I must say theirs is very very good,, creamy with lots of vanilla. I\u2019ll definitely be back!",

This is the first time I've been new L\u2019lncontro since they moved to Manhattan and everything has changed. Compared to Astoria, the restaurant is smaller and uncomfortable with many tables crammed into a small space, and the delicious freshly baked bread had been replaced by mediocre bread. One of my favorites, the lobster salad, was as delicious as ever, but Branzino had changed from a simple yummy grill to a tomato sauce flavor. Napoleon used to be filled with banana cream but now replaced with lemon cream. No more strawberries on top. Too bad, because for the past 15 years this has been my #1 favorite restaurant in NYC. It's changed from what it used to be, but it's definitely still at a high level.",

To start the customer service was phenomenal and I was impressed with how the waiters remember all the specials because there were so many. They also checked on our table often to see if there was anything we needed. Now for the food, they have a Flatbread that comes with a red sauce to start which is very appetizing. We got the fig salad which was perfect to start along with the steamed clams. For my entree I got the Ravioli and I'm glad I did. Overall this meal was so satisfying that of course I wanted more. Happy most of all with the service. Thanks for having us and thanks for an amazing 1st time experience at your restaurant.  I'll definitely come back soon.",

I was also impressed by the fact that the restaurant owner, Bruno, was in the restaurant talking to, and serving, guests... A nice touch that was appreciated, a very lovely man and one that deserves to have a successful restaurant such as Club A.  I had the Shrimp Cocktail, the NY Strip, with sides of Broccoli, Creamed Spinach and Onion Rings, shared with my dining partners who both had the Chilean Seabass.  Everything was delicious and to a very high standard.  We did not order dessert but Bruno presented us with a dessert sampler platter and all of the desserts were amazing.  The costs for the meal was US$294 (including tax but before tip) which was reasonable compared to other American Fine Dining Steakhouses I have eaten in over the years.  I can't recommend 'Club A' highly enough and I take my hat off to Bruno and his whole team for providing such great ambience, service and food.  Thank You.",

They have also compensated us for our experience, which was very appreciated.",

It was that cold.  The beans were mush, the tomatoes were soggy, the egg tastes like vinegar, the potatoe was actually so hard it cracked when I bit into it and the bed of greens were marked with brown tips cut off.\nThe thimble of tuna it's was a tartar (some places it is not) was unremarkable, but I ate it anyway because I wasn't going to throw 35 bucks out the window.  The bread was tasty but cold, and the butter was too cold to scrap and spread.\nIt's been a minute since I've been here, and it's a one and done for me.\nNice room, pleasant people at the door, and a great bartender.",

I could practically feel the racial barrier xD.\nI had the lunch special steak 6oz and friesinstead of the 8oz, a wise choice because I didn't even finish it before my lunch break was over.\nI asked for medium well but I guess that's just medium here? Compared to Golden Corral, I preferred GC's.\nFries were a delight, the steak sauce was tasty and very creamy, so please explain any dietary restrictions to the person that takes your order. BE LOUD AND CLEAR ABOUT IT.\nI wish they had some mocktails on the menu, would've loved something fruity with that steak. I settled for ol reliable lemonade.\nThe Cokes and Sparkling water came in cute glass bottles, I wanted to take em and turn them into vases. Gotta be quick.\nI didn't have a chance to order the tartin dessert since I was late, will come back to try it another day, maybe a creme brulee if its on the menu :9",

We ordered 2 orders of the prime rib, both to be made Rare. They initially brought us two steaks and claimed they were both rare.  However, what showed up was one steak about medium and the second one about medium-well.  They were not fooling anyone. The medium-well piece was also the end piece. We confronted the manager that the steak was definitely not rare as ordered. An endpiece can almost never be rare in principle.  As per the butcher who cut the steak, they said they must cut the prime rib slab in order from the end piece start, and cut towards the middle regardless what temperature the patron is ordering. They stated we were the first person ordering the prime rib that evening so we get those first two pieces starting from the end.\n\nI have NEVER heard of this being a case for a steak serving establishment that we get no choice for the temperature of the steak. I'm not sure if this is the truth or were they just looking for the sucker that didn't know what proper steak is supposed to look like.\n\nIf they can't honor the steak rare or medium-rare, they should state that right before ordering or upon arrival of the dish.  They brought us two overcooked steaks and if we didnt speak up they would just leave it which i find unprincipled. The management did come by to apologize that the whole prime rib slab was more over cooked than usual Mondays. However, the tone of the apology was a bit defensive. At that point they recommended us to order something else. However, we already got settled at the table with an infant so we did not want to leave midist of dinner time for the sake of our infants sleep/feed schedule. The conclusion is we had to succumb to eating overcooked steak.\n\nThis place is also not stroller infant friendly.  They would only seat us outdoors away from the main restaurant or the corner seat near the bar.\n\nThe prime rib was supposed to come out on a cart and the steak is supposed to be cut in front of you. However, we did not get to see it given the outdoor seating we were forced to sit in.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: I would not recommend the prime rib if you are particular about how your steak is prepared.",

It\u2019s getting hard to find places left in Manhattan that feel like real, old New York. Places like Minetta Tavern or Caffe Reggio, and of course, JG Melon. Some complained about rude service, and okay, the older male host can be very short and come across as rude to someone not from the city, but he isn\u2019t. He\u2019s just an authentic New Yorker.",

After a ten-minute wait, we were finally approached by the captain who alone was permitted to distribute menus, which oddly only listed about a dozen items. Instead, he insisted on reciting over 20 specials, leading to some confusion and necessitated repetition.\n\nDespite opting to order from the regular menu, the captain served and charged us for individual pieces based on the number of attendees, rather than per dish as ordered. For example, instead of one Caprese salad, we were served\u2014and billed for\u2014seven separate portions at $15 each, without regard for whether everyone wanted it. The quality of the food, including the mozzarella, was also underwhelming.\n\nAdditionally, we received multiple unwanted dishes, further inflating our bill. The establishment itself was in poor condition, with torn chairs, unclean bathrooms, and malfunctioning fixtures.\n\nConcluding the evening, we were presented with a handwritten bill totaling $979, a stark contrast to what one might spend at high-end venues for superior service and ambiance. This experience was unfortunately memorable for all the wrong reasons. I have dined at many of New York's top restaurants and have never encountered such practices. I believe future patrons might appreciate a forewarning of these issues.\"",

It\u2019s more difficult to cook delicious food with simple cooking method or no sauce .because there is no way to fake it. In this respect, Dover sole was great! And I expected to be higher price since many reviews complain about over price. Well.. price was fine ,compared to other restaurants in NYC. At least here , taste is good. There are countless restaurants in nyc pasta is $ 40 , but tastes terrible.  And white truffles are fancy ingredients itself. Not surprising charge $100. (I did not order, i saw from the menu). And dover sole was $98. And .. dover sole is commonly over $80 ,easily go up over $ 100 anywhere in nyc .\n\nIssue is the service. They are friendly. However The way of manner is not refined . Too rush , no apologies for interrupting our conversation . Extremely obsessed with taking dirty plate away. I think they believe taking plates away  is the most important role as a server. Service did not match for price.\nBut again, food is good!",

I noticed there was a candle in front of the soap dispenser. I'm clumsy and generally look out for hazards as a result. It made me nervous. After requesting that the soap and candle be swapped, to avoid any potential accident, they fixed it immediately. The service was on point.\n\nMy table mates shared the peking chicken and I went for the tofu and mixed vegetable stir fry, but with black bean sauce. I cannot say how the chicken tasted as a vegetarian, although I tried the wrapping with cucumber, scallion, and sauce. It was delicious. My tofu and vegetables were great. The tofu was extremely soft and flavorful.\n\nBefore we received our main courses, we had appetizers. I must say that all of the appetizers were incredible. Noteworthy items for me were the scallion pancakes and cauliflower bites. If you have an issue with salt intake, you might want to ask for less salt on the cauliflower as they are quite salty.\n\nI don't often come to fancy places, let alone a place as fancy as this. I like to make fun of how they refill your water glass so quickly. This time, I got less than a minute on how long it took to fill an empty glass. Mike got to my sister's water glass at 45 seconds!! When we came last year it was around 3 minutes for that server back then. Speaking of water, make sure to specify whether you would like tap water or bottled water. We thought the bottles were refilled, but were made aware that every new bottle cost $11 when Mike gave us one \"on the house.\" Thankfully, when we asked for another bottle taken off because of the confusion, they not only comped one more, but another one on top of that. I was pleasantly surprised by the generosity in their service.\n\nIf you enjoy Chinese cuisine, this is a great place to go. They truly elevate the experience. I felt like a prince.",

The trick by adding lo mein to the chicken salad wraps (with the sauce) was a HEAVENLY COMBO! The Crispy Beef was too good and the Filet Mignon was PERFECTLY cooked. I wasn\u2019t sure if I was going to like it cut into pieces when I got but geeeeeeezzzzzzz that was the best Filet Mignon I had this year.

The staff are very nice and eager to please.\n\nIt seems they mostly serve take-out and deliver orders as the atmosphere in the restaurant itself leaves much to be desired. They also serve dine-in meals using only plastic which was a turn off for me. Hopefully they will be able to make some improvements in the future.\n\nIn regard to their delivery service, we only waited about 30-45 minutes before they were at our door and the food was hot and fresh unlike DoorDash or other delivery companies which tend to make stops along the way.

The menu is crazy extensive, they offer a variety of different types of Asian cuisines outside of sushi, from pad thai to ramen, bentos and donburi bowls. Would definitely recommend the sushi rolls over some of the noodle dishes. It\u2019s not a glam place to take out of towners, but a simple, no frills, solid takeout option after a long workday-kind of place with some seating if you don\u2019t want to deal with packaging. Last note is they close well before 10, generally around 9:30-9:45 at the latest for orders and you\u2019ll definitely not be allowed to dine in after 9:20.",

So, the lowered price menu on this Unagi Donburi was very satisfactory. One decent sized unagi coated with a generous amount of teriyaki sauce over a type of rice which was not a standard Japanese variety.,The restaurant is small and has several tables though very outdated and basically on average, adequate for its purpose. It\u2019s a nice family owned business, not authentic Japanese per se, but they do a really brisk business for its location on Second Avenue. Recommended if, it\u2019s something quick and easy for grabbing a quick fixed meal, for sushi or other deep fried selection. The tempura was not at all the same in pricier places but, palatable at best.",

It is definitely one of the restaurants that started the sushi culture in the early 1990s for New Yorkers and still keeps its class to some level. For sushi perhaps, I have had better looking ones, however, the full umami flavor from its aged fresh fish was another level. You can copy the look, but the flavor was unique and this place had that depth. Of course out of their own pride or dignity, they are too cool to offer miso soup or a maki along with the nigiri. Nonetheless, I think you still need to try it at least once. I personally found their saut\u00e9d tomato garnish over the salmon nigiri very interesting. It was such a surprise how much umami flavor came out from pairing the salmon and tomato. Also, the funniest part is that the $140 sushi omakase comes with fresh wasabi, but the $40 something chirashi comes with cheap soulless dry wasabi lol...you definitely get what you pay for here....or a bit less.\n\nSpeaking of the chirashi don, even though you are getting low quality, gloomy wasabi, the fish on top of the sushi rice are still very pronounced. The snapper was aged well, as I chewed a few times its flavor hit my tongue. For the akami, I usually feel that it is bland compared to other tuna cuts, but not from here. It is definitely a nice and economical way to taste aged fresh fish flavors.\n\nI see many reviews of disappointment with the food or service. However, it is worth trying in my opinion.",

The brownies and tarts are delicious. On the downside, my dining in experience was sub-par. Service was pretty slow, and the food was just ok. I much prefer the bakery items. The French cream donut was also sort of a miss for me, it tasted old. Not sure if that\u2019s how it was supposed to taste or not. Nonetheless, high stars for the lemonade and other baked good items. Also, the man working at the bakery register is always very pleasant every time I stop by!",

My tomato sandwich, for example, left me feeling unsatisfied. To make matters worse, the iced matcha latte had clumps of undissolved matcha powder, and getting the bill took another long wait.

After tables have been set up, we thought it would be omakase experience by the bar but were sat on table. Which was totally okay. The issue was, they were quick to get our orders but the time it took for 5 dishes to arrive took a lot longer than expected. There were gaps as long as 30 minutes just waiting for the next course. The staffs were very quick to remove the finished plates off the tables but for the next menu to come out there were numerous awkward time gaps between. The guests next to our table left after being upset. We managed to receive all our menu and took us about 2 hours. The staffs did apologize every time our dishes came out but still was not something I expected.\n\nWorst part is when they come out with the dishes and explain the menu, you cant hear them even though they are right next to you. The music sound and restaurant noise made it impossible to hear the explanation. We just ended up nodding our heads and eating and guessing. Reminded me more of a bar due to the loud noise and music.\n\nFood was good but wait time and atmosphere were far different from what I expected.

Highly recommend this place if you get the chance.",

One of the best meals I had in the 80s was at the Drake Hotel, when Jean Georges was the chef, with a group of my fellow staff from the River Cafe. We were blown away. It was so good.\n\nThe last time I ate at JoJo was probably in the 90s since I'm rarely in the upper east side. But I've certainly been to other Jean George restaurants downtown and many of the places the Tin building.\n\nHence my shock at some of the dishes we had the other night at JoJo.\n\nPinky toe crab dumplings sounded amazing, but were thoroughly disappointing when it hit the table. It looked like a bowl of beige liquid. The lemongrass flavor was very one note and overwhelming. The dumplings were uninteresting. There was no garnish. Just a sad looking dish.\n\nThe Greek salad with beets was almost worse. Any NY diner makes a more appetizing and certainly more generous Greek salad albeit without beets. It was flat and skimpy with an acrid dressing.\n\nRidiculous at a restaurant of this \"caliber\" and cost to ask how a guest wants the fish done and then not cook it the way they asked for. For the record medium rare was requested and well done was how it arrived.\n\nMy charred duck was indeed blackened but the skin was not crisp. It was flabby and inedible.\n\nThe only decent dish was the chicken. Although the potatoes tasted briny which was odd, but may have been the intent.\n\nThe waitress accidentally showered us with champagne which she was very apologetic for. It may have been a blessing since they comped the terrible appetizers as a nice gesture.\n\nIt's crazy to me that a chef with such a great reputation let's his staff drop the ball on keeping up his standards.\n\nOh, and the acoustics were crazy loud. So noisy.",

Service was superb from start to finish.\n\nBread service was a great way to start. The cute little gluten free loaf comes with a side of olive oil and is delicious! The butter is fantastic as well.\n\nFirst course: we had the herring and king crab Skagen. The herring was good and the dish was well balanced even though ours was dairy free and went well with the gluten free crackers. The king crab Skagen was a standout - essentially a perfectly executed king crab salad on a delicious buttery brioche bun.\n\nSecond Course: the cod was an absolute stand out. Our expectations was high given its nordic cuisine and fish forward and even then they were exceeded...the cod was beautifully cooked where it was moist inside but somehow still maintained a nice crust. The flavors were perfectly balanced and we couldn't stop raving about this dish. The Wagyu short rib was decent but we wouldn't really recommend it and would advise to stick to the fish forward dishes here...ours was a bit dry but the seasoning and demi-glace was on point.\n\nDessert: the artics bird nest is a thing of beauty and as delicious as it is pretty. Flagship worthy and honestly transcendent. This is a dish that cannot be missed. They were kind and also gifted us with a complimentary chocolate dessert which was also very good.\n\nOur server was the perfect balance between being friendly and warm while still delivering Michelin level service and attention.\n\nFood was beautifully presented and well executed. We really enjoyed our meal and will definitely be back with our daughter as she loves seafood.\n\nThank you for such a memorable experience and lunch team Aquavit!",

The cook started to yell at us when we didn\u2019t answer quick enough if the food was \u201cto-go or for here\u201d. They started just throwing out to go food in bags with a paper plate. Cook just had an overall disgusting attitude and we were nothing but nice. They were forgetting orders, getting an attitude when we were correcting them, raising their voices. My pizza wasn\u2019t bad, but the service was absolutely unacceptable and my classmates dishes were forgotten, carelessly thrown into bags, aluminum foil was cut and lodged into pepperoni rolls, and the list goes on. very disappointed.",

My review will encompass service and drink choices since I came in for happy hour. Decor and service were top-notch; also quite surprised to see this tavern literally next door to my office. Layout includes a very long bar with seating opposite and more seating upstairs. The drinks menu is also quite long-a number of beers and cocktails. I had a couple of their beers during happy hour for half price. Service was professional, friendly; the staff was very well dressed. Looking forward to returning to try the food menu, in particular considering that David Burke is just blocks away.",

Having stayed at other Kimptons, like the one in Paris, it\u2019s hard not to feel that comparing them would be disrespectful to the other properties.\n\nWhile there was a large team of concierges, most of them were indifferent throughout our stay. They rarely greeted us or opened doors, often too busy chatting or on their phones. The exception was the team members who helped us with our luggage on Monday, 21st October around 5 PM, genuinely nice and helpful.\n\nThe breakfast was a huge letdown. The complimentary options were extremely limited\u2014just a croissant with fruit or an American breakfast. I waited 40 minutes for my order to arrive, only to be told that the delay was because I ordered hard-boiled eggs, which apparently take longer to prepare. As for elite members,  was surprising that not even a complimentary bottle of water was provided in the room, aside from a $10 bottle of still water for purchase.\n\nOne of the most frustrating aspects was the charge for storing our luggage after check-out\u2014an absolutely ridiculous policy. The room itself was very basic. No coffee machine, no blankets, and the pillows... To make matters worse our room was located next to the cleaner\u2019s storage room, which meant banging doors starting early in the morning.\n\nThe few positives: we had an amazing view from the 21st  floor, with a great view of the Empire State Building. The cleaning staff was also very friendly.\n\nWhile the hotel is in a walkable location for many Manhattan sights, the area itself felt noisy and a bit tacky, with street vendors constantly trying to sell you something. If I were to return to New York, I\u2019d probably stay in Chelsea instead, where the food markets and restaurants seem quieter and offer a better overall experience.",

I went to Bryant Park to see the Christmas lighting and it started raining and I found solace on this restaurant as it\u2019s bang opposite to the park. It\u2019s gorgeous from inside. We had a crab cake which was delicious and ordered  seafood pasta which had clams, scallops and prawns. This one was very good too. And the best part was the dessert- called as chocolate tart but it\u2019s actually a lava cake which was nice crunch on the outside and gooey inside. The ice cream had some crunch too. We ordered one more because it was so good\u2026the restaurant was closing down but still they managed for us. Great service too! Will come back soon!",

The food, in my opinion, is rather average and nothing to write home about. On the other hand, I must commend the staff for being extremely welcoming and efficient. If you plan to enjoy the outdoor seating during warmer weather, my recommendation is to arrive early for lunch. Personally, I find the food to be quite bland and definitely overpriced. However, if your goal is to savor an appetizer and a drink while taking in the views, then this is the ideal spot for you. If you're solely interested in finding food around Bryant Park, you might want to consider visiting L\u2019Adresse American Bistro or Los Tacos 1 instead.",

It had 3 oysters in it and honestly, the meal felt too creamy when both the New England clam chowder and the pan roast are ordered. The pan roast didn\u2019t taste like anything special and didn\u2019t have a good wow factor to me.\n\nMoving onto the service, our server didn\u2019t seem very attentive. We got our water filled maybe 2 times throughout the whole meal and we were left with no water quite often.\n\nOverall, it seemed like Grand Central Oyster Bar is a place with a great atmosphere, though it really fits the needs of a tourist which is a nice vibe and cool location.

They did still get us in which was great.\n\nOur waiter seemed very nice but maybe a little nervous. He might have been new. After we had already ordered and started eating we noticed that people around us were being told the specials of the evening. We were never told of any specials. Everyone else so seemed to be getting bread and we never got bread. Two of us had steak which was absolutely a 5 out of 5. Another member of our party had chicken which was dry and overcooked. The blueberry cheesecake for dessert was phenomenal.\n\nOne member of our party had finished their steak but clearly had a large dish of mashed potatoes sitting in front of them. A woman, not our waiter, came up and scooped away his plate, knife & fork without asking if he was down or even pausing. Another member of our party gave him our extra fork to finish his potatoes. He pulled the side plate up where the dinner plate used to be and was working on the potatoes. A few minutes later the same woman came through and scooped up that dish and took it away even though it was half full. He was done eating so it was okay but we found the behavior very strange! It didn't seem very busy and they were a lot of empty tables but we definitely felt like we were hurried right out of there!\n\nThe building was beautiful and I'm glad I got to experience this place once but I probably would not go back.

Unfortunately, the experience here didn't quite measure up. I tried the Shack Stack along with two limited offerings. Korean Style Fried Chicken Sandwich and the Korean BBQ Burger. While the Shack Stack was somewhat decent enough to try, I wouldn't rush back for the burgers in general. The BBQ Burger and Chicken Sandwich were particularly disappointing. The BBQ Burger had a slight hint that reminded me of Korea, but overall, the quality of the burger didn't live up to expectations. As for the Chicken Sandwich, it lacked any real connection to the Korean flavors I was hoping for. Real miss on execution for both. Another downside was the service. The attendant seemed somewhat reluctant to assist us, which didn't help the situation. It's a reminder that not every experience can be perfect, even in a city known for its incredible food scene. There are always exceptions, a sign of the human element in every establishment. This location might be a hit for some, but the miss for me.",

There's black mold in the showers, the faucet control fell off, the shower door doesn't stay closed, there's not even a bottle of water for you even though you paid $250 (with the stupid facility fee), there are weird stains everywhere. They also charge to hold your luggage which is $6 - the parking lot downstairs doesn't allow access to your car until you leave. The TV channels had 5 working channels. The outlets didn't work. The area around the hotel is bad too, there's lots of homeless if you head south. I can list more and more things about how bad this hotel is. Just avoid it and go to a Holiday Inn or something.\n\nThe one good thing is the bathroom water pressure is high. That's it.\n\nManagement and YOTEL should be ashamed about the state and condition of this hotel. But I guess they don't give a crap because they're serving unknowing tourists that go to this area.\n\nAlso, this hotel has the weirdest elevator design. Parking to hotel is one elevator, which is fine. Then you take the elevator to the fourth floor to get to the restaurant, THEN another elevator to the rooms. I've never seen a hotel with this unintuitive design for their elevator.\n\nI will never stay at a YOTEL in any other city again either.

The staff are friendly, and we enjoyed the espresso bar each morning. On the other hand, as others have said, the rooms are outdated, with sloppy silicone repairs in the shower, mould, and a general tired appearance. I would recommend staying here, if you are able to get a good deal and if you are only going to use the room as a place to sleep.",

However, with closer inspection, wear and tear become apparent, hinting at overuse and a need for better upkeep. The furniture and fittings, once impressive, now feel slightly worn. It would make a difference if the hotel manager focused more on maintaining these aspects instead of overlooking them.\n\nThe lobby\u2019s atmosphere is mixed; while the setup is stylish, the staff often engages in loud, personal conversations, creating an unprofessional vibe. As a guest, overhearing unrelated chatter isn\u2019t the warm welcome one expects. Politeness and professionalism should be prioritized to avoid feeling like one is experiencing \u201cstreet-level\u201d interactions inside a supposedly refined space.\n\nThe room service team does a good job with cleaning, but the pillows had an unpleasant smell\u2014I\u2019d recommend bringing your own if sensitive. Additionally, aimed at eco-friendliness, is frustrating\u2014guests expect efficient amenities, especially when paying for a comfortable stay. Most visitors already have a strong environmental conscience and customers would appreciate a more thoughtful approach.\n\nIn general, YOTEL has a solid foundation but would benefit greatly from attention to detail, staff training in etiquette, and improvements in maintenance. The experience has potential, but execution could be stronger to make guests feel more valued and comfortable.\n\ud83d\udd34 Note: The sound insulation is very poor.",

Keens Steakhouse owns the largest collection of churchwarden pipes in the world with origins going way back into the 17th century! Today, Keens is the only survivor of the Herald Square Theatre District. It\u2019s a very sophisticated, warm, and enchanting environment upon entering the doors and you\u2019ll immediately be in awe of the history of this brand with a strong showcase of their churchwarden pipes collection. There is a space just for cocktails and also 2 levels for big and small groups to dine in. Reservations in advance is highly recommended. Service staff is very efficient, friendly and helpful. We got our seats in less than 3minutes; not much waiting to be done.\n\nWe split the porterhouse for two with a group of 4 and added on the mutton chop, which at a whopping two and a half pounds, is a sight to behold. Meat was tender, crusty and flavorful even when cooked to their medium well preferences. Creamed spinach was decent; oysters were very very fresh and enticing. New York Cheesecake was a superb ending to our meal as well. It comes with a hefty price tag but worth the indulgence and experience for sure. Wine menu is extensive as well even though we skipped the pairing for the evening. Super decent experience on overall and would recommend.",

This is a tourist location unlike any other Hard Rock location.  I believe the burgers were par grilled . The food came out pretty fast because it was already prepared before I ordered. I know not to order sandwiches on. Busy night at this location . The margaritas were delicious @ $15 blue moon beer @ $12",

The food, unfortunately, lacked the vibrant Latin flavors that are supposed to be the hallmark of Cuban cuisine, leaving much to be desired.\n\nI ordered the Chicken Platter, expecting a flavorful and satisfying meal. Instead, the chicken was undercooked and lacked the seasoning that would normally bring it to life. It was a real letdown, especially considering the potential of this dish. The sides were just as uninspiring, failing to deliver the bold, comforting flavors you\u2019d expect from a Cuban restaurant.\n\nThe only bright spot in my meal was the can of Coke that I had with it. It\u2019s disappointing when the best part of your dining experience is something as simple as a soft drink, but that\u2019s how it went.\n\nWhile the service was friendly and the atmosphere decent, the food itself fell flat. I hope Sophie\u2019s can bring back the authentic, rich flavors that make Cuban cuisine so special, but based on this experience, it\u2019s hard to recommend this location.",

They had attended prior to the epidemic and experienced the revolving floor that added to the dining appeal.\n\nSad to say that the floor no longer turned and menu was set, everyone eats the same thing, so hopefully you liked everything being served on the menu because there are no substitutions. In exchange for the revolving floor, you got a \u201cshow\u201d of a miniature chef preparing each course that they bring out to you.\n\nWhile the staff was friendly and attentive and the meal presentation was cute, we were stunned and less than impressed by our enormous bill. For two people the bill was well over $400 which was more than our round trip flights to the city!! We were totally shocked and thrown off by this, as was our friend who had been a patron there before! She said that every about this experience had changed and was nothing like she remembered and wanted to share the experience again with us.\n\nBeware before booking your reservation as this is NOT budget friendly and you will want to make sure your taste buds align with the menu. This is not something I would recommend to a friend as I am sure there other nice eating establishments that would cost far less!",

Unacceptable especially if you are a family with kids because the family will be split.\nSecondly the level of service is very poor and the personnel is clearly non trained for a supposed high-level restaurant. During the waiting time for the preparation of the table, the personnel offers you a cocktail (nobody told us what it was, and I have assumed that it was a Spritz, but not sure! Nothing have been offered to our 3 kids) and some appetizers. They put everything on the desk at the entrance and don\u2019t go through the various clients.\nFood quality is medium-high, but clearly no wow. Wine pairing is a nightmare. The wine chosen for every dish is simply horrible..Unacceptable for Europeans! Please allow clients to chose a bottle of wine or to pay more to have better quality.\nAt last, we wait 10 minutes (!!!) in a queue to have the elevator and go out\u2026we were waiting for a lady from the restaurant with a badge which allows to call the elevator. Crazy!\nAnimation and virtual show was funny.\nAt the end the price is too high for what you get. And giving a French sounding name to the restaurant will not improve the quality.",

The bottom line is while still a superior restaurant, the price does not reflect much more than the payment to restore the spinning restaurant mechanism that makes \"the view\" worth it in the first place.\n\nPlease note, and if you've seen our other reviews, you know that, at All Set Vacations, we pride ourselves on providing true and transparent editorial content based on all my years as a journalist and educator.\n\nWe paid $1200 for this experience.\n\nDefinitely arrive early. We shared drinks a snack in one of the lower floor restaurants first because we read that it might not be enough food, it definitely was enough food and the wine at dinner was also enough alcohol to suffice anyone.\nBy arriving early, we enjoyed three different appetizers. They were ok, but mostly breading, so, nothing special.\n\nThe show is cool, but, as a photographer and cinematographer/media person myself, felt a bit dated. Essentially, there is a ultra high resolution projector above your table with four specifically placed circles that mark your plate. That way the projector can the two-dimensional animation at the same time to all four place settings. It's a simple two-dimensional cartoon chef that runs around and you enjoy his antics for a few minutes as he prepares what you're about to eat and then the food is served right afterwards. That's pretty much it. It was cool but nothing that was mouth dropping or eye opening other than just being a novelty. It would definitely be worth a look to do it once but not sure if it warrants the heavy price tag. I'm not sure if I would recommend coming here just for this part alone. However, the food, plus this experience, depending on your preference for something different could make it worth it.\n\nNow for the food itself at dinner. The food was amazing, but, heavy! How anyone can say they didn't feel they ate enough is beyond me! The cream base on many dishes filled us up and we definitely felt it! The portions are fine. I did a little digging and looked up each one of the pairing wines individually. They are all very highly ranked and we're all delicious. We have more of a preference for red and we know a bottle of stag sleep alone is a $100 bottle. So having two glasses of that was wonderful. Put that together with all the other ones and if you're a wine person, this is like having a high-end flight. I also included a picture of the menu to see all food and beverage offerings.\nThe dinner courses were fantastic, fresh, and served perfectly. The lobster included a portion of a tail and one claw (would have loved more of that for the price like half of a normal 8 oz tail or skip the rubbery claw even though it helps the presentation). The beef short rib was very tender as well. The first course, again, solid, and the desert was complex and balanced.\n\nSo....let's lay it out and see if it gets an 'All-Set' seal of approval.....-after the breakdown.\nLet's be generous and assume each wine glass costs $20. For my wife and I, that would be $160 total.\nLet's give the first course a $20 price on a normal menu, that's $80 for all four of us.\nSecond course $30 each normally, $120 total.\nLet's assume each main entree of short ribs would be a max of $50 each- $200 total.\nAnd dessert, $20 each or $80 total.\nSo... for 4 people, 2 adults and 2 kids:\nThat's $640 for a really wonderful dinner for the four of us at a decent high view of the other tall buildings in the area. ( remember, it's not spinning currently). Add in a tip of 130 and that's $770.\n\nThat's essentially a markup of $430 that is likely paying for the projector and, from what we learned, management to save up to turn the spinning motor back on!\n\nFinal thoughts: if you can rationalize the extra costs for the experience, do it once but, without the spinning view, the view ( name of the restaurant)! isn't great. But, the food, drinks ,and service is worth $640, but not $1200!",

The food was incredibly delicious, perfectly seasoned, and absolutely fantastic. The ambiance was just okay in the restaurant, not the best. It's definitely not a place where you can feel overly romantic or kid-friendly. On second thought, maybe a little more on the romantic side, the place was very dark. However, my son and I enjoyed it, so we ended up paying $120 for three courses - an appetizer, main course, and dessert - which was definitely worth the price due to it being restaurant week in NYC.",

He was very pleased the place was very clean and the service was fantastic . I probably would not go back due to the lighting being so dark as even when ordering I had my reading glasses on and had to use the light from my phone to see what's there but if I should go back if my husband wants to go the only thing I will ordered is the wings.and the spicy Is margarita.",

Christian probably been scamming other customers,  we just happen to call him out on it.  We had vouchers each morning for breakfast.  I believe they were for $38 or $39 each of us, each morning.  We only had oatmeal and juice and he charged us the full amount of each voucher and INCLUDED his tip on top of that , so he could maximize his tip.\nThe other morning no tip was ever added.  We  tipped  cash the other two mornings. Christian told he was required to add tip .  We asked for a manager and Christian told us the manager would not be in until later that afternoon.\nManagement should look into Christian past checks to see if he has SCAMMED other customers.  Not a good look for a restaurant to have.  Having a server over state a bill just to gain a bigger tip and mandatory  a 20% tip",

Also got yellow rice and beans. I will note they have a $13 minimum when ordering take out. The meal deal is 8.99 so added the rice and beans to make it past the $13 minimum. It was 13.99 plus tax but still a good deal. You get plenty of food. Everything has good flavour. Picking up is easy, just had to wait in the waiting area but the hostess let's you know when your food is ready. She was friendly. Will definitely order from here again",

The experience started out strong, and our server was very nice and informative. As the night went on the service got worse and worse. They bait you into ordering their still Fiji water bottles and then don\u2019t bother to continue to ask you if you\u2019d like another, instead they keep bringing them to the table, open them, and then charge you. 5 people at our table ordered the seafood and shellfish platter for $56/ person. There wasn\u2019t even enough food on the platter for each person to have one of each of the items. A few other people ordered additional apps that he forgot to put in, so they never got them. Overall food was okay, steak was cooked well and sides were good. But for the prices, we all agreed we had better steak before. As the night went on our server was no where to be found. He offered us espresso on the house and then forgot about it, so we waited 30 minutes. Overall not worth the almost $3k check for this \u201cupscale\u201d steak house.

From the moment we sat down, Lorena, our server, was phenomenal. She broke down the menu in detail, helping both me and my coworker get a full picture of what STK had to offer.\n\nI already knew I wanted the tomahawk steak, and Lorena was on board with our plan to order two separate ones (because, let\u2019s be real, we\u2019re big guys). The steaks were incredible\u2014juicy, perfectly seasoned, and cooked to perfection. We also ordered lobster to go with our meal, which was delicious and paired well with the rest of our platter.\n\nLorena\u2019s service truly stood out. She was attentive, ensuring our drinks were always refilled, and her warm demeanor made the experience even better. It\u2019s rare to find someone so dedicated to customer service, and because of her, we\u2019re definitely coming back.\n\nThe food was outstanding, and I have to mention the drink I had\u2014it was called \u201cBonded and Free\u201d (or maybe the other way around), but whatever it was, it definitely gave me a buzz, which says a lot for a big guy like me. All in all, STK Steakhouse is a must-visit for anyone looking for top-tier food and even better service. Highly recommend!",

The issue was, they were quick to get our orders but the time it took for 5 dishes to arrive took a lot longer than expected. There were gaps as long as 30 minutes just waiting for the next course. The staffs were very quick to remove the finished plates off the tables but for the next menu to come out there were numerous awkward time gaps between. The guests next to our table left after being upset. We managed to receive all our menu and took us about 2 hours. The staffs did apologize every time our dishes came out but still was not something I expected.\n\nWorst part is when they come out with the dishes and explain the menu, you cant hear them even though they are right next to you. The music sound and restaurant noise made it impossible to hear the explanation. We just ended up nodding our heads and eating and guessing. Reminded me more of a bar due to the loud noise and music.\n\nFood was good but wait time and atmosphere were far different from what I expected.

Pricing was not so-focused on delving value, as one expects with a diner, but not to the point that it was overpriced. There wasn\u2019t a host there to seat you, so you sort of have to do it on your own. The waiter was the kind of person who is there for decades and knows the business of being a server to the point of being an institution within the industry - but not because it is how the business operates. He did what he could to make the best of the experience, but it\u2019s clear he knows why people aren\u2019t too happy. Very much a no-frills arrangement. However, ambiance was really modern and lively. It was here that Nick Jonas performed his hit \u201cBacon\u201d live, together with Ty Dolla Sign at the 2016 VMA\u2019s.",

Now, I'd be ok with that if the food was any better than what I'd expect from an old hospital or third rate amusement park. If this was Chuck E Cheeses then I'd say I got what I expected. But this place had a higher bar.\n\nThe mozz sticks were passable. At least, they were when they arrived as they were still kinda warm?\n\nHad to ask 3 times to get my water refilled. Asked for ranch when I ordered the tenders, got nothing.  When I asked for ranch again, I got buffalo sauce.  The chicken itself was terrible. No flavor, and again, kinda warm?  The fries were ok if you like soft, soggy, flavorless fries.\n\nTried some of the buffalo chicken grilled cheese sandwich. Different chicken, oddly, and marginally better. The buffalo sauce could have been straight vinegar for how potent it was. And again, warm. So warm the slice of American cheese that made this a grilled cheese sandwich wasn't even melted.\n\nWe were seated quickly, but then the staff turned into ghosts. Place wasn't all that busy, either.\n\nNot sure how this place gets high marks in anyone's book.  Avoid. Taco Bell Cantina or White Castle are right up the road.",

The overall experience was outstanding, thanks to the delicious food, cozy atmosphere, and attentive service.\n\nOur bartender, Edward, provided exceptional care, ensuring our lunch at the bar counter was memorable.\n\nThe menu offerings did not disappoint. Standouts included the savory Ma po tofu, flavorful purple and white rice, perfectly cooked string beans, and tender shredded chicken with yellow chives.\n\nThe spicy cucumber appetizer, however, fell short of expectations. Instead of the anticipated spicy kick and perfect marinade balance, it consisted of fresh cucumbers topped with a few red peppers, lacking flavor and seasoning.\n\nDespite this minor misstep, I highly recommend this place.\n\nReservations are essential, as wait times can reach 40-60 minutes. Our bill totaled $112 for two people, including six dishes and hot jasmine tea \u2013 a reasonable price for the quality and quantity.\n\nKudos to the team for the elegant business card design, reflecting the restaurant's attention to detail.\n\nOur rating - 4.5/5.\n\nThank you and good luck.",

But Oceana deserves all the stars \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\nI found this place by accident when I looked for a pre Broadway birthday dinner for my mother in law . I\u2019m so happy I did, because we had the best experience. I booked the table for 6pm on a Saturday on the same day. We were greeted by staff, they asked if we\u2019re seeing any show after, they made sure they take care of us before we needed to head out for a show. All of the staff members were very attentive and kind. Sommelier for wine pairing painted pictures in my head when telling about beautiful regions that made my wine taste even better.\nWe were intrigued by the menu and wanted to try everything. So we went with 4 course chefs tasting menu. The portions were perfectly sized to be able to taste everything they bring. Every single meal and wine pairing was beyond this world!\nOur kids couldn\u2019t care about anything else than pasta and pizza, which they happened to have on their kids menu. It was a nicely prepared food, unlike anywhere else where they don\u2019t put effort into kids meals.\n. It was also refreshing to be in a place with a good family sized tables, where it\u2019s not too dark, loud and crowded unlike anywhere in NYC. Perfect for a family dinner to enjoy a dinner conversation with loved ones. I would go back every day if I could , couldn\u2019t recommend more! Thank you!\u2764\ufe0f",

There was a family at the next table and the dad had oxtails. His food looked so good that I took a picture.\nThe downside was that we mixed up my desert order so I had to send it back for the correct item (it was still missing the coco ice cream). The flan de huevo was basic. Each table receives white rice and black beans. I prefer my black beans more seasoned. Then there was the cost. For gaucamole, 2 entrees, 2 cocktails, 1 bottle of water for the table, and one dessert, it cost about $200 (including tax and tip).\nVictor's will be a treat because weekly would be over $800 a month for two people.",

Waiters were friendly, service was about what you would expect for a restaurant of this caliber however, I do think it is generally overpriced for the value. Fortunately, my group dined off the restaurant week menu and saved a few bucks. There are a variety of interesting authentic Italian dishes and fascinating La Masseria takes on others. Tiramisu was amazing, the chicken was flavorful, my water was never empty. Overall, I would return if only to try a few more dishes.",

For dessert we ended with tiramisu, espresso, a cappuccino and the cheesecake. Everything was delicious and the portions were great! Would definitely recommend.",

However, what completely crossed the line was when he leaned on my clothes, which was hanging on my chair, while celebrating a birthday at the next table. I looked at him multiple times, but he avoided eye contact. And the fact that his greasy hands touched my clothes? That was infuriating.\n\nThis waiter looked like the youngest among the staff, and it seems like he needs to get his act together. Please, assign capable staff to all tables instead of reserving inexperienced ones for seats that feel like they\u2019re meant only for people of color.\n\nI still left an 18% tip, consoled only by the fact that the food was good.

I\u2019ve been to Russia and it\u2019s even better here than there. During the Summer months it\u2019s not busy at all and getting a reservation is easy. In the Fall it\u2019s very busy and you can visit all four floors. The decor is like stepping into a Time Machine and the vibe is stunning. The service was also that of the past with every need being met by several different servers at every turn. I\u2019ve always wanted to go to this memorable restaurant and I\u2019m so glad I did. It was worth every penny. We 100% plan to go back for tea during the holidays.",

Might want to wear sunglasses to subdue the stunning surroundings (lol). It's fun to take it all in. The booths are fabulously comfortable and best of all, despite the d\u00e9cor, it is a sedate dining experience. My wife and I do not like loud and here the noise level is civilized. Your focus is on the food, not on the table next to you talking nonsense loudly. Staff is outgoing and service is faultless.\n\nSurprisingly, at the time of this review RTR has a 3.9 star rating. It is much better than that, but I think I know the reason. Basically it depends on what time you go. Wife and I have eaten here a few times. The only time we have been disappointed is when there is an event at Carnegie Hall, which is next door, and it feels like the kitchen at RTR is overwhelmed. Get the food out no matter what. The food taste's like an assembly line dish as do the cocktails. Not bad, just mediocre. An example would be the time my wife had Vegetable Wellington, which was a thumbs down. Virtually tasteless. Same for the Sea Bass I had. Not terrible, but considering the price and previous dinners there it was very disappointing.  Super long wait to get seated as well even though we had reservations. Like a 1/2 hour wait. Other patrons were in the same boat. Lots of complaining and RTR was packed. On the positive the noise level was not annoying even though every table was taken and as always the service was impeccable. So the secret is....late lunch or early dinner.\n\nNow the good. Our last dinner was an early one having made reservations for 4:30. A wonderful time and a great meal from start to finish. Not crowded and quite a few tables available. Appetizers where an RTR salad and RTR Borscht. Salad greens were fresh and the maple vinaigrette along with the goat cheese crumbles made for a perfect salad. My wife described the RTR Borscht as good as a friend's home made ( a recipe from \"the old country\" as in Eastern European) Borscht. High praise indeed. A beef pirozhoz was an accompaniment and was noted to be delicious. In the past we have also had Khinkali and Onion soup. Both were very satisfying. Main courses were Cotelette Kiev (chicken) and Potato Vareniki. The chicken was moist and tender with a wonderfully crisp and flavorful skin. The sauce was sublime and added just the right amount of pop to the dish. Fresh vegetables rounded out the dish. Delish and same for the Vareniki. Deserts, Blintzes and Cr\u00e8me Brulee, were very good. Although the Blintzes were satisfying the portion size was extremally disappointing. I'm almost never taken aback by portion size, but good lord two tiny Blintzes that would blow away if you sneezed. Would not order again. They were good, but not like they were the most shockingly good Blintzes that would justify their price. You've been warned. On the flip side definitely order the Banana Nalysnyky. Ten thousand thumbs up on that one.",

We ordered an apple tart for dessert that was also very good. But, at this price point something should have been extraordinary. I will say that our primary server was very friendly and attentive, as were the supplemental servers.

This iconic spot is said to be America\u2019s first pizzeria, and after one bite, you get why it\u2019s been around forever. The pizzas are absolute perfection \u2013 thin, crispy crust with a touch of char, topped with fresh tomato sauce, mozzarella that melts in your mouth, and basil that feels like it was just picked. The classic margherita is chef\u2019s kiss, but honestly, every pie on the menu is a winner.\n\nThe vibe at Lombardi\u2019s is pure old-school New York. The walls are filled with history, and the atmosphere is warm and bustling, like a true NYC institution. It does get busy, so plan for a bit of a wait, especially on weekends. But once that hot, delicious pizza hits the table, you\u2019ll know it was worth every minute.\n\nNow, heads up \u2013 the pizza is fantastic, but it\u2019s definitely on the pricey side for what it is. You\u2019re paying for both the quality and the history, so just keep that in mind. If you\u2019re visiting NYC or even if you live here, this is one of those places you have to check off your food bucket list. It\u2019s New York pizza at its finest \u2013 just with a bit of a premium!",

The waters never arrived, even when we asked for some to go. It felt a tad bit disrespectful having to ask constantly, but maybe it was just an off night.

We ordered escargot, balthazar salad and seafood ceviche for starters and for main I had the new york strip, and my wife and daughter ordered the steak and fries and her roommate had chicken...The escargot were really yummy and the salad was delicious but the ceviche was the best quality seafood ceviche I have had in a very long time. As to the main meal, the chicken was tender and tasty, the steak and fries (both) were just right and I enjoyed the new york strip. The fat and meat were both cooked to perfection.... For dessert we had pavlova and ice cream profitrolls. The rolls were OK but the chocolate sauce was sublime, dark chocolate with just the right smoothness and taste... The pavlova was a disappointment to me. I have had better in so many countries and back home. The merengue was too too too sweet and the texture was off. Plus I am accustomed to a pavlova with cream and not a lemon/lime mascarpone.... Anyway, the desert was not enough to detract from the experience.  I had a great time with lovely company and excellent food.... A definite place to visit.",

The decor reflects its long history, making it feel like a step back in time. It's a casual, laid-back space that caters to a mix of locals and tourists.\n\nFood\nAs a dim sum destination, Nom Wah offers a wide variety of traditional Cantonese dishes.\nShrimp dumplings : Delicate and filled with plump shrimp.\nShrimp ball : fried ball with shrimp like a fish cakes.\nPork buns : Soft, fluffy, and filled with savory, slightly sweet pork.\nTurnip cakes:Crispy on the outside, tender inside, and full of flavor.\nEgg rolls: Not your typical egg rolls\u2014these are more substantial with a crispy shell and flavorful filling.\n\nThe food is fresh, flavorful, and made to order rather than served from carts, as is common in some dim sum spots. This guarantees the dishes are hot when they arrive at your table. However, some find the menu more limited compared to larger dim sum halls.\n\nPrice\nNom Wah is reasonably priced for NYC, especially considering its historic status and location in Chinatown. While not the cheapest dim sum in the city, the prices are fair, and the portion sizes are generous.\n\n\ud83d\udc4d\n- Authentic and flavorful dim sum\n- Historic and charming atmosphere\n- Reasonable prices for quality andlocation\n\n\ud83d\udc4e\n- Limited menu compared to other dim sum spots\n- Service can be slow during busy times\n\nNom Wah Tea Parlor is a beloved NYC institution, offering a nostalgic dining experience with solid dim sum options.

Am definitely coming back again when I'm in town!\nI ordered so much food for 3 adults and 1 child \ud83d\ude06 Gave my 2 inlaws (first time there too) a mini lecture on what the different dimsum are. Thankfully they were daring to try everything except the chicken feet \ud83d\ude06\nEach serving was around 3 pcs with some 4 pcs. So eventually I ordered a lot,  there were dishes we had to half so everyone can taste each.\n\nPayment\nThey only accept AMEX or cash,  which almost disrupted my plan to eat as much as I can.  Luckily my BiL treated us to lunch,  but I did find I had enough cash despite my ordering around 8-9 dimsum and the total was a reasonable $63.\n\nBathroom\nUsed to 1st Men then 2nd Women,  but someone decided to put M/F pics so unisex.  Eventually decided to stick to the Women's on the right *unless you're desperate then go to the unisex originally Men's\nTypical mostly Male users = stinks a bit and for was ewwww vs the originally Women's one\n\nThis place meets my expectations of what an authentic dimsum is from my childhood.  And as one who has traveled to enough Asian countries to appreciate not Westernized Asian food that usually ends up lacking in flavor and/or too thick wrapper for the dimsum.",

It had a good flavor I will say that this restaurant is more of a Mexican cuisine than Cuban. We really enjoyed the atmosphere and the corn on the cob was on point. We will definitely come back when we need a quick bite, but not when we need a full meal. The service was OK, but they seem to be overwhelmed by the amount of customers that the restaurant can handle we had to ask for napkins like three times also getting the attention of the servers was a difficult as they\u2019re moving around a lot. The bathrooms are very tiny, the lighting is very dim, There is lots of posters and graffiti, but it goes with the neighborhood , I did not feel an AC running inside the restaurant so I am not sure if they run the AC during very hot days .Overall, not a bad place but again make sure you do you your research and check the menu before going in.",

Even my all linen fit was futile against the heat.\n\nWe entered the non-descript 39 seat hole in the wall cafe with tiled floors, a handful of barstools and faux leather booths for seating, and ceiling fans being the only weapon against the heat. It was JUMPIN, but we got a seat right away as they turnin tables quick.\n\nThe interior is a little beat up, and I mean that in the best way possible. I've never been to Cuba, but Cafe Habana is authentically Latin American. It reminds me of small places in Mexico or Puerto Rico that don't look like much when you enter, but the food BANGS.\n\nIt\u2019s a no frills place. Not like Tacombi though, don't get it twisted. Tacombi plays on Mexican culture, talking about the balmy beaches of the Yucat\u00e1n and sharing the beauty of authentic Mexican culture with the world and then looks you dead in the eye as they charge you $6.98 before tax and tip for a tiny little fish taco with no sides. Don't get me started on Tacombi. Tacombi is like big pharma to me.\n\nEnough about the opps, my b.\n\nWe ended up ordering the world famous corn, plantains, the cubano sandwich, and the marinated roast pork. The grilled corn, dressed in mayonnaise, cotija cheese, chili powder & lime was actually insane\u2026 I was initially like \u201cdamn this Equinox trainer has me paying $5 for some corn\u201d but thank GOD I did. I forgot one of the few absolutes in life\u2026 CORN MAN GETS PAID!!\n\nThe cubano sandwich ($18.95) came with fries, which is a rarity in NYC these days. It consists of Citrus marinated roast pork wrapped in ham with swiss cheese, chipotle mayonnaise & pickle on a toasted roll. The pork was so juicy that little pork juice was squirting down the roll on every bite\u2026 that visual is crazy lol but it was delicious.\n\nIf you're reading this and don't live in NYC you're probably like \"damn that's expensive he's trippin...\" but this is par for the course in the city, and absolutely Nolita/Soho cheap.\n\nI'm fascinated that a place like Cafe Habana exists in the Nolita/Soho area. I would expect it to be deep in Alphabet City or Union City. Idk. Cafe Habana is just so unpretentious, right smack in the middle of one of the most pretentious places in the world. New York City continues to surprise me everyday.\n\nIG @jnov_\nTiktok @jnov_reviews",

Each dish was bursting with flavors that were both rich and delicate, surprising me, especially since I\u2019m not usually a big fan of Chinese cuisine. Congee Village truly changed my perspective. The variety and quality of the dishes we tried were remarkable \u2013 everything tasted incredibly fresh and well-prepared.\n\nOne of the highlights of our meal was the value for money. We were a group of eight, and the portions were impressively large, yet the prices were unbelievably affordable. It\u2019s rare to find such a great combination of quality and quantity at such reasonable prices in New York City.\n\nI highly recommend Congee Village to anyone looking for an authentic and delicious Chinese dining experience. Whether you\u2019re a fan of Chinese food or just curious, this place is worth a visit. I\u2019ll definitely be returning!",

At 5:40AM another customer comes and has to start banging on the window multiple times for them to sign through the glass that they\u2019ve decided to open at 6AM today instead of 5:30AM as listed on the door and online. Completely understand things happen in a business. Employee could call out, short on supplies, etc. However, common sense and common courtesy would say to put a sign on the door or have a 5 second conversation with your customer waiting outside your door. Were they planning on having me wait outside for 30 minutes? If someone is going to get coffee at 5:30AM in NYC, they likely have things to do and can\u2019t afford to wait around.

What makes this place a gem is the hidden pathway to get in there. Makes it more vibrant. The food was delicious! The tuna tortas were so good we had to go for two orders of them! The pitchers aren\u2019t as strong as we\u2019d expect, so if you want a good strong drink stick to what you know. I had to get the mezcal pina and that drink by itself did justice over the pitcher. I loved the music and the service was amazing. They were attentive without being too much and the servers knew their menus to recommend which tacos to get since I\u2019m a taco fanatic. Like always I go for the birria tacos and they did not disappoint. Our favourite was the Aztec soup which is highly recommendable! The flavours that capitulate your taste buds are everything. Then we ended the night to their dance floor room to end the night, so if you want to have fun afterwards (post 9:30pm), then you\u2019ll enjoy a night to eat and a good night for dancing. Highly recommend!",

They do mix with white tequila (Puerta Negra/Black Door) to give it a little kick since the pulque's bottling process changes the fermentation process. We also tasted the original pulque flavor.\n\nWe ordered the Molcajete, which had chorizo sausage, steak, chicken, shrimp, and nopales (cactus), all sizzling in a sauce in the volcanic molcajete bowl. Also tasted the tacos al pastor. They served it with a good portion of diced sweet pineapple, and it wasn't greasy.\n\nService was great as they were constantly checking to see if we were ok, needed anything, and cleared the table of any used plates.",

Overall my experience was average, not really worth the money spent. Total $272 for 2 people tasting menu + two teas.\n\nAmbiance - is nice and simple, lighting is quite dim. There is an open kitchen in the middle, where you can see the chefs preparing dishes.\n\nStaff & service - staff is very warm and friendly, explained the dishes and answered our questions patiently. Service was quite quick, they brought the next course as soon as we were done with current. We got two complimentary dishes as well during the five course meal :)\n\nNow coming to the food\nComplimentary welcome item - we got carrot mousse served in a savory crunchy cone. It had different textures and flavors.\nPresentation- 9/10, taste - 9/10\n\nFirst course item - lettuce dish. Nice burst of flavors and lots of textures from creamy to crunchy.\nPresentation- 8, taste - 9\n\nSecond course - tomato dish. Nice pairing of donut, feta cheese and tomato jam\nPresentation- 8, taste-9\n\n2nd complimentary item - it was clear broth with sesame seeds and turnip flat noodles. It was quite tasteful as well.\nPresentation-7, taste -8\n\nThird course - corn dish. This dish was also good. Had few corn chips, corn soup, cilantro and little pasta bites.\nPresentation-6, taste -8\n\nFourth course - Eggplant dish. Liked the coconut curry and outer crust of the dish, however I didn\u2019t like the texture of the eggplant filling. It also lacked seasoning in the filling.\nPresentation-7, taste -4\n\nFifth course- Caramelized onion ice cream\nDefinitely a novel concept. Onion ice cream is sandwiched between choco chip cookies and served with framboise (raspberry sauce). If you eat ice cream on it\u2019s own, you can definitely taste onion flavor. It wasn\u2019t really something that I would go again for. But with the cookie and raspberry sauce, onion flavor gets masked nicely and is not overpowering. But I am glad I tried this wild flavor of ice cream \ud83d\ude04\nPresentation-7, taste - 7",

Parm on Mulberry St. is a tiny restaurant that serves some of the best italian cuisine in big portions at a reasonable price. Although their menu is on the smaller side, each of their dishes come out fresh, hot, and very tasty. I usually enjoy their pizza garlic rolls and mozzerella sticks for appetizers and eggplant parm platter for dinner. The best part is that all the platters come with a side of spicy rigatoni that is very similar to the one at Carbone. Basically, you get a 2 in 1 deal when ordering a platter.\n\nSeating is very limited and it is crammed in the restaurant so be prepared to enjoy a hearty meal on a small table while bumping elbows with the person next to you. There are a couple tables in the restaurant and outside. There is also bar seating.\n\nThe staff is very friendly and attentive. They are good at making conversation and make you feel at home while you enjoy your meal.\n\nThis place is a must try!",

The burger was solid and the sweet potato fries and aioli that came with it were tremendous. We ate every last bite of both of our plates and look forward to coming back and trying more of their items.",

As someone who isn\u2019t vegan but enjoys exploring different cuisines, I approached this experience with an open mind. The service was excellent, and the atmosphere was pleasant, which made for a welcoming start. Located in a bustling area, it's definitely in a prime spot.\n\nWhen it came to the food, I have to be honest\u2014I would rate the bibimbap a 5 out of 10. I'm a big fan of Korean cuisine and particularly love bibimbap, but this version didn\u2019t quite hit the mark for me. It was also my first (and probably last) time trying tofu skin wraps. On a positive note, the portions are generous, so you certainly won't leave hungry.\n\nWhile I may not return, I think this place is worth checking out if you're vegan. It offers a different take on some classic dishes, and you might just find your new favorite meal.",

The food reminds me of the meals that are served at yoga or wellness retreats - plant based whole foods that may be a bit \u201ctoo healthy or bland\u201d for some but still flavourful and will fill you up.

While I appreciate the effort, the mock meat we had was was dense and chewy, sauces were on the sweeter side, gravy flavor wasn\u2019t balanced and the samosas were more like small thin savory pastries rather than the traditional Indian ones. The wild rice, though healthier, wasn\u2019t the best complement to the gravy. The japchae was the only dish I really liked. I was hoping this would be a go to option for us with multiple locations in the city, but sadly no. It took a long time to get to us and when lukewarm and needs to be reheated, changes the texture and consistency.",

The waiter spoke a mix of Chinese and English, which made communication a bit challenging, but looking back, it was a fun and memorable experience. They have an enormous vegetarian menu, unlike anything I\u2019ve seen at similar restaurants. The prices are super affordable, especially for NYC, and the portions are huge. We ordered one main dish for each (two people), but quickly realized that a single main dish would have been enough for both of us. Many other people were taking leftovers home, which would have been a good option if we weren't staying at a hotel. Highly recommended for anyone looking for delicious, filling vegetarian food.",

I've ordered many dishes and in my opinion, the vegan chicken is the best meat substitute! I find the vegan pork meat to be very soft and unappetizing. I really dont get why some people like it. The flavor is just okay. I recommend the chicken flat rice  noodle, pan-fried noodles with chicken, and chicken stir fried thin rice noodles. The chicken has a nice char flavor and texture is medium firm. The overall prices are moderate to expensive for what it is.

Unfortunately, we had some issues with the pizza. Of the four types of cheese, I only felt mozzarella, which became quite rubbery when it cooled. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it, as you won\u2019t taste the Parmesan or Gorgonzola in this pizza at all.\n\nThe last pleasant moment was that we received a complimentary sweet treat at the end.

The pizza was very good, I don't think it makes a difference in which pizza you decide on, they make a great pie!\nTo our surprise after dinner they brought us a very good plate of fried dough with icing sugar!\nThere is a very nice courtyard out back.

They serve unpretentious Tex Mex sprinkled with seafood and burgers. I only tried the nachos but they were absolutely stellar. The beef was high quality, the guacamole was amazing and they make their own hot sauces. The green sauce was my fave. Sadly they don\u2019t bottle the hot sauce for retail sale, or I\u2019d purchase a couple. I can\u2019t wait to return and try the burgers, I saw several of them hustled past me, one with gigantic fluffy onion rings. They looked as good as any burger I\u2019ve seen. This place came highly recommended and it lived up to the hype. Great job.",

We didn\u2019t have a reservation and most definitely did not need one. Once we arrived we opted to sit at the bar. We had come during happy hour and were excited to have the opportunity to try some dishes and drinks out. Noted with beer but also tried the Casanova cocktail which tasted more like a vodka based summer drink. When it came time to food we dined on their tater tots and prosciutto pizza. All great for sharing! I\u2019d totally recommend this for a more intimate occasion if you do end up visiting.",

The elevators are prompt although very small. And there's a gorgeous staircase if you want to get your steps in. The rooms have some variability. So you might not get what you think you're getting. Given this is a very old building, it can come with problems. Our room had a leaky water valve that flooded the area in front of our toilet, plus a towel bar whose screw had come loose and popped off the wall, and a thermostat that wouldn't heat or cool the room, or even blow air. It's always good to ask for maintenance as soon as you see a problem, as the room cleaners don't check that level of detail. Desk clerks were really nice. We didn't make use of the breakfast vouchers because the lines were pretty long just for free coffee and pastries. If I could improve their rooms it would be with in room coffee makers and mini fridges.",

The selections are served family style. I think this adds to the conversation and family friendly atmosphere. The food is remarkably well prepared. I thought the spaghetti carbonara was excellent. It can be a difficult dish to get right. Some restaurants will take shortcuts that will impact the flavor of this gourmet dish. The rigatoni bolonase was ok. The Carmines salad and the cold antipasto were both wonderful dishes. My guests commented that they should not have filled up on the bread! The bread is very moist and tasty. However, the salads and the main dishes are pleantyful. I will repeat the advice from my guests. Do not fill up on the bread! Carmines is not a first choice for quiet dinnertime conversation! The place is full of chatter from the other tables. You will hear people singing happy birthday mixed with general crowd noise. Yes it can be noisy at times, but it is a happy noise that doesn't seem to get in the way of nearby conversation.  All in all, the food was delicious and the experience for my first time guests was a pleasant one. They were very happy with the food and the dining experience.",

But Talia's is just lacking the attention to detail that is necessary for a great dining experience. There were just two, overworked waiters. We always had to flag them down. Brisket is supposed to be soft and tender -- we had to send ours back because it was hard and tough. We ordered a steak instead but both appeared on the bill. We should not have to worry about checking things like that. We had a large party and several appetizers and side dishes never appeared. We had to flag the waiters down for them too. Even getting our water filled was a chore. Wires were hanging out all over in the corner, it did not look nice. At the end the waiter handed me my credit card back. I asked for the receipt and he said there is no paper receipt but announced to the table how much the total charge was. Not cool. Maybe I could overlook one of these things, but put together it made it not feel like a special dinner out for the hundreds of dollars we spent. Next time my wife and I are making plans to go out we'll go someplace else.",

My friend keeps kosher but was also vegan, so we were looking for things to order that we would both want. We ended up with the classic stew, I got the meat version and she got the vegan. I tried hers and it tasted EXACTLY the same. You\u2019d think that means they did such an excellent job replicating the meat flavors, but to us it felt more like the meat was an afterthought in the stew. They say they bring in chefs from these cultural backgrounds (Haitian chef was Haitian, their Indian popups have been Indian chefs) but to me it felt like they must\u2019ve told her the audience can\u2019t handle the full flavor of her food \ud83e\udee3 I felt bad, as I\u2019m sure she\u2019s a great chef, but the food we tried didn\u2019t have any strong flavors, and certainly none that stood out as unique to us. Our expectations were sky high as we both travel a lot and I eat dairy out, so we weren\u2019t sure what we were expecting\u2026 I just think we were hoping for more brightness and shock value than this. In NYC, you can try an authentic dish on almost every street corner from a part of the globe you may have never heard of, but it\u2019s the best thing you\u2019ve ever had. Here, the food was fine and unassuming, but did not blow us away with any incredible flavors. I want to keep coming back to popups but please allow the chefs full creative control of their meals! We like Talia\u2019s and I do not want this fi be seen as a negative review, but I would love for them to prove to us that their popups can be truly authentic. :)\n(This same friend stopped being vegan and went to the Indian popup more recently and reported a similar experience).",

We were all pretty hungry, & my boyfriend and I had walked past E.A.T a few times, so we all decided to check it out. Even though it was a busy weekend, they sat us immediately. The staff were friendly and very attentive. The menu had a variety of options, but not an overwhelming amount. The food was amazing and came out quickly. I tried motza ball soup for the first time and was very impressed! Since it was my man\u2019s birthday, they gave us complimentary cookies and sang \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d. It was a wonderful lunch with a warm and welcoming atmosphere. Another great part is that you can grab a pastry to go or come sit inside for a nice meal. Will definitely be recommending to friends and family! \ud83d\uddfd\ud83e\ude75",

A bit pricey but worth it - the more you buy, the better the deal (ranges from 10-full buckets etc.\n\nOtherwise - staff is friendly and the big scale sports games are usually on all the time, if not, there\u2019s music playing.

We were not expecting to find such a beautiful building designed in glass with a grass roof in the middle of Lincoln Center!\nFrom start to finish, the experience was incredible. We were sat immediately and greeted by our kind server. We asked for recommendations and nothing disappointed. We had cocktails, shared entrees and shared desserts. I've been to New York a number of times and I look forward to making this a staple for each visit following.",

Fantastic food selections and cocktails that are surprisingly good but size-wise they may have some wondering [what\u2019s this?]. Overall wonderful combos nevertheless. The outdoor tables are especially nice during the better part of the dryer seasons even in autumn, here in Manhattan. Very sensational location situated directly from the Lincoln Square\u2019s main plaza and the fountain. And within walking distance of the No. 1-subway line entrances a couple of blocks away. A definite stopover before or after the opera begins, or when the concert or film ends to grab a bite and schmoozing with friends or colleagues at a table. Reasonable prices and moderately expensive. Plus some great late after-hours Happy Hours too through the weeknights and weekend vibes. With several locations located across the cityscape for convenient accommodations.",

Broiled pork chop, lomo saltado, squid ink fried rice, seco de res. You're welcome.\n\nI've been eating at the Amsterdam location for years but recently I've been coming to this one. It's a family run spot with a full Chino Latino menu. Think a collision of Chinese and Peruvian/Spanish. They've got some straight up Spanish things, totally Chinese and in between.\n\nFor starters, definitely try the papa arequipena. It's a Peruvian potato either cold or fried with this red pepper sauce and hard boiled eggs and olives. It's a very unique flavor. If you're there on the weekends, grab the shrimp stew. It's an ultra tasty shrimp soup with rice, corn, a bit of spice.\n\nThe broiled pork chops are probably my favorite pork chops anywhere. They're brined incredibly well are dotted with chopped garlic that caramelizes under the flame. It's so insanely juicy.\n\nSquid ink fried rice is a must. It's a squid ink coated fried rice with ham, shrimp, pease and a unique ginger flavor. The lomo saltado you definitely need to get. Sliced steak in a stir-fried sauce with onions, tomato and french fries on top of rice.\n\nThe other items I'd recommend are the seco de res, a cilantro-centric tender beef stew. The tallarin verde is a Peruvianish pesto pasta, it's great with the garlic shrimp.\n\nNo matter how much good stuff I've eaten, Flor de Mayo is in my list of restaurants I love going to and bringing visitors to. It's something that's tough to find but it's a testament to the melting pot that NYC is.",

Steak with onions + fried rice was the best thing I ate. But I\u2019ve had just as good at the Chinese spot. The eggroll? A true fusion that idk what it was. Why does all the food have cinnamon? The Chinese spot where you pay $10 has better food. Don\u2019t come here and pay $28 for it. Just go to your local Chinese spot. I\u2019m now on the toilet sick just 15 minutes after finishing eating. The bathroom is gross and had graffiti all over it. Zero stars.",

This low-key yet elegant spot has an ambiance that's both cozy and inviting, making it the perfect escape from the city's buzz. The restaurant's quiet, intimate atmosphere, frequented by locals, adds to its charm--it's a place where you can truly enjoy a relaxed evening out.\n\nThe culinary experience was just as impressive as the setting. I started with the octopus carpaccio, which was fresh, tender, and perfectly seasoned, followed by the salmon tartar--light and refreshing, with a beautiful balance of flavors. For mains, I opted for the seafood paella and the shrimp curry. The paella was generously packed with a medley of fresh seafood, and the shrimp curry had just the right amount of spice to leave a memorable kick.\n\nIf you're looking for a refined yet unpretentious spot for seafood on the Upper West Side, Atlantic Grill is a gem worth visiting.

Pictured are the antipasto salad, burrata, calamari, tri color salad, chicken parm, chicken francese, seafood pasta, & the spaghetti and meatballs. Fun fact, chicken francese was not on the menu but the chef made it and it was absolutely delicious and came paired with spaghetti made in the francese sauce. After about an hour, we cleared our plates and we were on our way enjoying the great weather in the park. Stop by Pomodoro Rosso for a great meal.",

Inside, the ambiance is typical, but more importantly, the staff offers excellent service, and the value for money is outstanding.\nEverything was plentiful and delicious, with a flavor profile friendly to tourists.\nHighlight: the pesto.

Immediately, we felt at ease, and Wade welcomed us and treated us like the happy celebratory humans we were. This was a beautiful way to discover a new place to hang out while in the city. I am hoping we can start an open mic night or something, so I will be coming back to speak to Wade and the manager about that. My only complaint is having to go down a flight of steps to get to the restroom. It's not fun when you're tipsy to have to go up two steps, down about 12 steps, and then down 2 more steps. Yes, I counted it was actually a running joke all night with us (though my count may be off, I was really tipsy at this point.) Overall, I really enjoyed this place, and it's all because of the bartender and how amazing he is. Thank you, Wade!!!",

From other reviews, I was expecting to be blown away when in reality, this place is just good.\n\nThe atmosphere: is a small place with limited seating inside and a more extensive outdoor area. The aesthetic is nice but nothing special.\n\nThe staff: were nice. Besides taking my order and giving the check, there wasn\u2019t much interaction or service. The food came reasonably quickly.\n\nThe food: was good. The guacamole was a bit wet. In my opinion, the pork tacos seem a little dry. The platter I had was tasty but needed a sauce.\n\nCleanliness: Good",

The jazz brunch is my favorite time to dine, with delicious options of more breakfast oriented and also pasta or steak options if you\u2019re feeling like diving in. The menu is excellently curated with a diversity of flavors and colors, from salads to seafood and meats between dishes like the tuna tartare, steak and eggs, ragu pasta and some fun desserts like the Zabaione prepared in front of the table. Banana pancakes with ricotta is a classic for brunch. The food is good quality and menu is great but I feel some of the dishes are unbalanced, too salty or sweet, and I\u2019ve had a couple underwhelming dinners so four. (Overcooked steak, pasta with very little sauce, a complaint). The sparking and white wines are great, but you\u2019d be missing out if you didn\u2019t also indulge in some of the exquisite reds from their extensive Italian wine list (by region/ wine character).

Love it This is a great place to eat.  The building used to be a hotel for artists but now is a high end condo bldg.  The Restaurant was run by the artists for years, but now is run by a very high end group.  First class room, first class service and the food is out of this world.  Started with the marinated anchovies that were bright but not too strong.  Just right. Love the meatballs app and the black truffle custard with asparagus.  Both are must haves.  I had the spaghetti carbonara which had just the right amount of sauce and huge chunks of homemade bacon.  Really good.  She had the old family Lasagna recipe which was full of flavor and great texture.  We had many desserts.  One of the best was prepared tableside.  It is a custard poured over fruit.  I do not know the name but it was really good.  It was a beautiful evening and we will be back again for sure.  LOVED IT.   Check out all of our reviews.

One of our group of four was delayed about 20 minutes due to a flight issue, yet we were promptly seated without him so that he could join us when the flight issue was resolved. We appreciated being seated despite our party not being complete!\nThe night we went, there was some kind of private event going on so we had to sit outside. However, the outdoor seating was lovely - the best outdoor dining experience I\u2019ve had yet in the city! It was a warm evening and yet the mosquitoes didn\u2019t bite me to death, and the turf grass was a really nice touch.\nOur server was incredible. She was a true professional. She had excellent recommendations and she also sent over an excellent sommelier when we were deciding on wine. The wine was fantastic - a smoky, earthy French wine that I don\u2019t recall the name of (forgot to snap a pic of the bottle \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f) and the sommelier steered us in a perfect direction.\nWhile the pre-dinner cocktails and dishes themselves came out slowly due to the private event, the staff was very accommodating and expressed their apologies. The food really made everything perfect.\nFor dessert, everyone got something sweet except for me \u2014 I had their cheese plate. Highly recommend.\nDefinitely recommend going here for a special event! And you need a reservation! All in all, it was lovely.",

The wine selection is short but very good. Macchiatos and biscotti were just right and the ricotta cheese cake was excellent. In many places tiramisu is almost always cloying and sweet and mushy but this was ideal. This is a terrific little restaurant on the Upper West Side.",

The brownies and tarts are delicious. On the downside, my dining in experience was sub-par. Service was pretty slow, and the food was just ok. I much prefer the bakery items. The French cream donut was also sort of a miss for me, it tasted old. Not sure if that\u2019s how it was supposed to taste or not. Nonetheless, high stars for the lemonade and other baked good items. Also, the man working at the bakery register is always very pleasant every time I stop by!",

While we were promptly seated, it took a significant amount of time for our server to acknowledge us. Once we ordered, the portions were surprisingly small, especially considering the price. My tomato sandwich, for example, left me feeling unsatisfied. To make matters worse, the iced matcha latte had clumps of undissolved matcha powder, and getting the bill took another long wait.

I felt like this was dishonest and put a damper on our otherwise wonderful meal.\nAmbiance (5/5): The establishment is pretty small but very organized and neat, clean, and welcoming! We were seated next to the chef's table and loved watching the preparation right in front of our eyes. The chefs worked together seamlessly to prepare the various dishes with special garnishes, sauces, and presentation.\nService (4/5): We were warmly greeted at the door. Warm towels for wiping at the beginning of the meal and during the middle course.\nHe went out of his way to ask us in advance if we wanted a birthday dessert since there was only 2 left in the back so he could reserve it. They came out with a sparkler candle for us! Free green tea with the dessert.\nFood (5/5): We chose the combo omakase for $180 (4 sashimi & 8 sushi). Every single dish was fresh and delicious! Presentation was exceptional and the tastes were infused with art.",

As you step inside, the refined ambiance, with its classic Chinese motifs, sets a serene and welcoming tone.\n\nThe menu offers a delightful journey through American Chinese culinary traditions. Dishes like Chicken with Three Nuts, Chicken with Vegetables (Moo Goo Gai Pan), Hot and Sour Soup, and Wonton Soup are prepared with meticulous attention to detail, reminiscent of the first Chinese food my mother took me out to enjoy. The quality of ingredients and the chefs' skill shine through, making each meal memorable. These are not new fusion dishes but traditional American Chinese dishes.\n\nThe old-fashioned service at Shun Lee West is impeccable. The attentive and courteous waitstaff provide a smooth and enjoyable dining experience. The restaurant maintains a peaceful atmosphere, allowing for relaxed conversation and a leisurely meal.\n\nOverall, Shun Lee West is a charming throwback to the golden age of fine Chinese dining in America. Its combination of classic dishes, impeccable service, and quiet elegance make it a true gem on the Upper West Side.",

Thankfully, I have returned and what better way to start off before I headed to Shen Yun yesterday is this upscale Chinese Restaurant. First off, this place has very impressive decor. The atmosphere felt very positive and the servers were very attentive to all the tables. It was my very first time eating there and their recommendations were spot on and true to their word. Their Mai Tai was pretty good and their Pork Fried Rice with General Tso's Chicken made my stomach performed the \"happy dance\" the whole time. Yes, it was really that tasty.\n\nAdditionally, I love how they were quick to notice that my water supply was low and immediately refilled it without me saying anything. Bonus points for that. Anyway, they checked on me often to make sure I was okay and it really made me feel valued and welcomed. In the end, although my bill was a little more than expected, I was not surprised because the quality of the whole restaurant was worth every penny. For those who appreciates Chinese culture like I do, you will not be disappointed because I will highly recommend this place to you.",
